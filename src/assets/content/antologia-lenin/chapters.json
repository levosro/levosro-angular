For very many reasons \u2014 including wars, decolonization, technological change, and the spread of communications \u2014 the twentieth century has been a time of revolutionary politics throughout much of the world. Among the revolutionary leaders and theorists who have come to the fore during this time, the most remarkable in many ways and the most influential is Lenin. When the centenary of his birth was officially marked in his homeland, Russia, in 1970, one could see signs in many places saying: \u201cLenin lived, Lenin lives, Lenin will live.\u201d Whatever the truth of that prophecy, and whatever the form of his present survival, the twentieth-century world has been profoundly and pervasively affected by the fact that \u201cLenin lived.\u201d</p>", "<p>It is no cause for surprise that this greatest revolutionist of his age was a Russian. The <i>ancien r\u00e9gime</i> of the tsardom had held firm long after most other great European states underwent their modem revolutionary renovations. The popular insurrection of 1905 (Lenin would later call it the dress rehearsal for 1917) made plain already that Russia had a rendezvous with revolution. No other country, moreover, with the sole exception of France, had such a rich tradition of revolutionary politics. If a revolutionary politician and thinker of genius was to emerge in the early twentieth century, Russia was the logical place for it to happen.</p>", "<p>\u00a0</p>", "<p class=\"mid\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Lenin and Russian Jacobinism</i></p>", "<p>Lenin must be understood both as the creator of a distinctive version of Marxism as a revolutionary theory and also as a person steeped in the native Russian, non-Marxist revolutionary tradition. He was clearly conscious of himself as a representative and in some sense a continuer of this tradition. In an article of 1912, commemorating the centenary of the birth of the nineteenth-century Russian radical Alexander Herzen, Lenin pictured his own contemporary revolutionary generation as being in direct line of succession to two earlier ones: the generation of revolutionary nobles and landlords whose representatives, the Decembrists, [A group of high-born guards officers, influenced by Western constitutional ideas (in some cases while serving abroad after the Russian defeat of Napoleon's army), who made an unsuccessful attempt to stage a troop rising in Petersburg on December 14, 1825, following the death of Tsar Alexander I. In later years their action was seen as the opening episode of the Russian revolutionary movement of the nineteenth century.] had awakened Herzen, and the later generation of revolutionary commoners <i>(raznochintsy)</i> whom Herzen had called \u201cthe young helmsmen of the gathering storm.\u201d Among the latter Lenin singled out for special mention Nikolai Chernyshevsky, a writer and critic who assumed intellectual leadership of the Russian radicals during the eighteen-fifties, and the heroes (as he called them) of the Narodnaya Volya (People's Will). The People\u2019s Will was the secret revolutionary organization whose leaders had carried out the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881.</p>", "<p>Between the eighteen-fifties and the eighties the various groups of intellectuals who made up the Russian revolutionary movement were loosely subsumed under the general title of \u201cpopulists\u201d <i>(narodniki)</i>. They subscribed to a distinctively Russian socialist ideology the foundations of which had been laid by Herzen. In the intellectual debates of the eighteen-forties between the Russians who called themselves \u201cSlavophiles\u201d and those who were known as \u201cWesterners,\u201d Herzen had been a leading Westerner \u2014 one of those who saw it as Russia\u2019s destiny to progress in the direction already being taken by the most enlightened European nations. However, disillusioning contact with European reality during and after the 1848 Revolution in France (where he had taken up exile) led Herzen to revise his earlier Westernism. Taking his departure from the old Slavophile image of the Russians as a \u201csocial people,\u201d he propounded the idea that the Russian peasant was an instinctive socialist and that the <i>mir</i> (the traditional communal village in Russia) was the nucleus of a future Russian socialist society. If the man of the future in France was the industrial worker, the man of the future in Russia was the peasant, the <i>muzhik;</i> and economically backward, not-yet-capitalist Russia, blessed by the survival of its archaic village commune, might in fact be destined to lead the world to socialism.</p>", "<p>The populist belief in Russia\u2019s special path and in a \u201cRussian socialism\u201d based on the village commune was not a part of the legacy of Russian revolutionism that found a continuer in Lenin. What he found enduringly valuable in the native revolutionary tradition was something else of importance: its model of the dedicated professional revolutionist and its wealth of experience and lore of clandestine political organization. These aspects of the tradition were associated, in turn, with a doctrine that became known as \u201cRussian Jacobinism.\u201d It held that a revolutionary seizure of power from below should be followed by the formation of a dictatorship of the revolutionary party, which would use political power for the purpose of carrying through from above a socialist transformation of Russian society.</p>", "<p>One of its early formulations appeared in a populist proclamation circulated in 1862 under the title \u201cYoung Russia.\u201d The author, P. G. Zaichnevsky, was leader of a secret group at Moscow University. The theory was more fully elaborated by such major figures of the populist movement of the seventies as Pyotr Tkachev and Pyotr Lavrov. According to Tkachev, a ruling elite of revolutionary intellectuals who had conquered political power through \u201cdestructive\u201d revolutionary activity from below would utilize this power for \u201cconstructive\u201d revolutionary activity from above. Relying chiefly on persuasion of the masses through propaganda rather than on coercion, they would gradually transform the country on socialist lines \u2014 building the <i>mir</i> into a genuine commune, expropriating private property in the means of production, fostering equality, and encouraging popular self-government to the point where the revolutionary dictatorship would itself no longer be needed. Similarly the leadership of the People's Will envisaged the establishment of a \u201cprovisional revolutionary government\u201d that would carry through a socioeconomic revolution from above, which would be ratified by representatives of the people meeting in a national assembly. Such was Russian Jacobinism in the setting of the populist movement. It had an enduring effect upon history owing to the influence that it exerted upon the political thought of Lenin.</p>", "<p>The populists of the seventies had been divided over revolutionary tactics, some advocating the gradual conversion, of the peasants to their cause through propaganda (as in the \u201cgoing to the people\u201d movement of that decade) and others arguing for propaganda \u201cby deed,\u201d meaning terrorist action. The latter group saw the Russian peasant as a potential rebel against authority, and reasoned that an act like the assassination of the tsar might spark a general conflagration in the countryside, a greater and successful Pugachev movement. The assassination of Alexander II in 1881 aroused no such peasant response, however, and led to more severe reaction under his successor, Alexander III. In the sequel many radicals from the populist camp turned away from the tactics of terrorism and lost faith in the peasantry as a revolutionary constituency. Meanwhile, another potential constituency was appearing in the still small but growing Russian industrial worker class, which numbered upwards of three million before the end of the century. [The total population of Russia in 1897 was 129 million. Peasants constituted four-fifths of the total. Emilian Pugachev was a Cossack who led a large peasant rebellion in the Volga region in 1773\u201475. He was ultimately executed.] Given all these conditions, it is not surprising that a section of the intelligentsia grew receptive to the ideology of proletarian socialist revolution being propagated by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. In a number of European countries there existed by this time Social-Democratic parties professing Marxism as their program and acting in the name of the industrial working class as their principal constituency. In 1883 a populist turned Marxist, Georgi Plekhanov, launched Russian Marxism on its career as an organized movement by forming a group for \u201cThe Liberation of Labor\u201d in Geneva, Switzerland, where he resided.</p>", "<p>The initial impulse of the movement, which had in Plekhanov a mentor as well as organizer, was the search for new ways in Russian revolutionary politics. The founding documents were Plekhanov\u2019s anti-populist tract \u201cSocialism and the Political Struggle\u201d and its continuation, \u201cOur Differences\u201d. In them he concentrated his attack squarely upon Russian Jacobinism. The conception of a seizure of power by a secret conspiratorial organization was a \u201cfantastic element\u201d in the People's Will program. The very notion of a \u201cprovisional revolutionary government\u201d exercising tutelage over the people in the process of building a socialist society was objectionable. A dictatorship of the revolutionary party was unnecessary and undesirable; the workers would not want to exchange one form of tutelage for another, and would no longer need \u201ctutors\u201d by the time of their future graduation from the historical school of revolutionary political self-education. Meanwhile, a premature capture of power by an organization like the People's Will, even supposing it to be feasible, would either collapse for want of popular support or else issue in a \u201cpatriarchal and authoritarian communism\u201d or \u201cPeruvian [that is, hierarchical and authoritarian] communism\u201d should the government survive and try to introduce socialism from above by decree. Hence the revolutionary movement should cease conspiring to seize power and give up all idea of carrying out \u201csocial experiments and vivisections\u201d upon the Russian people under the dictatorship of a revolutionary party. As for Russia's Marxists, they should join with other oppositionist strata of society, including liberals, in a political struggle to overthrow tsarist absolutism and establish free political institutions in their country. This democratic revolution would accelerate the pace of Russian economic development and permit a growing industrial proletariat to build its own independent political party like the Social-Democratic parties of Western Europe. In a future socialist revolution the workers would take power as a class.</p>", "<p>In these early writings, as it turned out, Plekhanov was laying the theoretical foundations not of the Russian Marxist political movement as a whole but of its Menshevik wing. The opposing, Bolshevik wing, of which Lenin became leader, showed the influence of some of the very ideas Plekhanov was attacking. But not until much later did all this become clear.</p>", "<p>When \u201cSocialism and the Political Struggle\u201d appeared in Geneva in 1883, the future Lenin was a carefree boy of thirteen growing up as Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov in the town of Simbirsk (now Ulyanovsk) on the Volga. His father, who was school inspector for Simbirsk province and as such a minor member of the nobility, died in 1886. In the following year Vladimir's older brother Alexander, a student at Petersburg University, joined a new People's Will group in a plot to mark the sixth anniversary of Alexander II's assassination by assassinating Alexander III. The plot was foiled. The young man was hanged, having refused on principle, and despite his mother\u2019s entreaties, to ask the tsar for clemency. This event greatly helped to propel Vladimir onto his own revolutionary career. His martyred brother became his hero and the annihilation of tsarism his implacable aim. [This is not to suggest that his motivation in later life may be summed up under a simple formula.]</p>", "<p>Soon after entering Kazan University in the fall of 1887 to study law, Vladimir was expelled for participation in a student demonstration. The police then exiled him to his grandfather's country estate in Kazan province. In late 1888 he received permission to reside in the city of Kazan, where his mother, sisters, and younger brother joined him. A year later the family moved to Samara (now Kuibyshev), farther south on the Volga. He read for the law examinations on his own, passed them in Petersburg in 1891, and later practiced law briefly in Samara. During all this time, however, his obsessive interest, and the main subject of his reading, was not law but revolution. Among the materials into which he plunged were the populist writings of the sixties and seventies. One that had been his brother\u2019s favorite, and now became Vladimir's, was the socialist novel that Chernyshevsky wrote upon being incarcerated in the Peter and Paul Fortress prison in Petersburg in 1862: \u201cWhat Is to Be Done? Stories about New People\u201d.</p>", "<p>In the novel's gallery of radical men and women, the legendary character of Rakhmetov particularly stands out. He is the scion of a landowning family of ancient aristocratic lineage. Soon after arriving in Petersburg at the age of sixteen to study in the university, he undergoes a complete conversion through a meeting with a young man of radical views, and dedicates the remainder of his life to the revolutionary cause. He reads prodigiously. On a trip to Western Europe he insists upon giving away the bulk of his inherited fortune to a poverty-stricken, great thinker and father of a new philosophy, \u201ca German.\" He cultivates extraordinary physical strength through strenuous exercise, by keeping to a diet of semiraw beefsteak and black bread, and even by working as a Volga boatman on his wanderings through Russia. He lives ascetically, taking no wine and rejecting the love of a young woman whom he would have wished under normal conditions to marry. On one occasion he tests his capacity to bear pain by spending the night on a bed of sharp nails. Of Rakhmetov and others like him, Chernyshevsky writes in the novel: \u201cThey are few in number, but through them flourishes the life of all; without them it would die out and go sour. They are few in number, but they enable all people to breathe; without them people would suffocate. Such ones are*few in the great mass of good and honest people, but in that mass they are as the flavor in the tea, the bouquet in the fine wine; the strength and the aroma come from them. They are the flower of the best people, the movers of the movers, the salt of the salt of the earth.\"</p>", "<p>This novel, furnished inspiration for several generations of Russian radicals. That it furnished inspiration also for Vladimir Ulyanov is well attested to by, among other things, the fact that he entitled his own revolutionary treatise of 1902\u2014the most important of all his works in historical influence\u2014What Is to Be Done? Conversing </p>", "<p>with friends in a Geneva cafe in January 1904, he confirmed that he had done so with the novel in mind. He angrily rejected a disparaging remark about the literary quality of Chernyshevsky\u2019s work, and confessed that it had influenced him profoundly, particularly when he reread it after his brother\u2019s execution: \u201cIt captivated my brother, and it captivated me. It made me over completely. . . . It\u2019s something that charges you up for the whole of \"your life.\u201d He went on to explain that \u201cthe greatest merit of Chernyshevsky lies not only in showing that any right-minded and truly decent person must be a revolutionary, but also something still more important: he showed what sort of person a revolutionary should be, what rules of conduct he should follow, how he should proceed* to his goal, and by what means he should attain it.\u201d<sup>7</sup></p>", "<p>Ulyanov\u2019s Marxist self-education began in the fall of 1888 in Kazan, where he studied Marx\u2019s Capital and made contact with a Marxist \u201ccircle\u201d (as clandestine study groups were called). It continued intensively after the family\u2019s move in the following year to Samara. There too he involved himself in the activities of Marxist circles. But these were not the only contacts that he made. He also sought out and conversed at length with former members of the People\u2019s Will who were living in Samara as political exiles. In these conversations with surviving representatives of populism\u2019s heroic period, he showed special interest in the old Russian Jacobinists, beginning with Zaichnevsky and his program of revolutionary dictatorship in the manifesto \u201cYoung Russia.\u201d \u201cIn talks with me,\u201d wrote one of the exiles much later, \u201cVladimir Ilyich often dwelt on the question of the seizure of power, one of the points of our Jacobin program. . . . Now more than ever I come to the conclusion that already at that time he was developing the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat.\u201d<sup>8</sup></p>", "<p>Therej is much to be said for this vievy. Though initially Lenin accepted Plekhanov\u2019s notion of a two-stage revolution in Russia, the thrust of his thinking all along was toward the creation without delay of a revolutionary party dictatorship dedicated to the transformation of Russian society\u2019along socialist lines\u2014the dictatorship that he founded in 1917. Thus in 1905 he opposed the Menshevik tactic of supporting the liberals in a strictly bourgeois-democratic revolution against tsarism, and gravitated to the tactic of telescop-</p>", "<p>7. N.

The soul of the classical Marxism of Marx and Engels was the teaching that the revolutionary proletarian dictatorship was the necessary political instrument of a society's transition to socialism and future communism. To be a genuine Marxist it was not enough to accept the theory of the class struggle; one also had to accept the doctrine of proletarian dictatorship as the goal and terminal point of this struggle. In practice, moreover, a proletarian dictatorship would mean a dictatorship of the revolutionary party on behalf of the proletariat. \u201cBy educating the workers\u2019 party,\u201d as Lenin expressed it, \u201cMarxism educates the vanguard of the proletariat capable of assuming power and leading the whole people to socialism, of directing and organizing the new system, of being the teacher, the guide,, the leader of all the working and exploited people in organizing their social life without the bourgeoisie and against the bourgeoisie.\u201d<sup>1</sup> Consequently, it would be in no sense un-Marxist for the party to seize power and rule dictatori-ally in the interest of building a socialist society in Russia. This was the practical political conclusion implicit in every line of Lenin's seemingly scholastic theoretical treatise on Marxist views about the state.</p>", "<p>It was a very Russian revolutionary soul that he breathed back into Marxism. Admittedly, the teaching on proletarian dictatorship had a significant place in classical Marxism, and one which later Social-Democratic Marxists, including even Engels in his old age, were inclined to downgrade. But it had not the central place accorded it in Lenin's Marxism, nor was the proletarian dictatorship conceived by Marx and Engels as a dictatorship of a revolutionary party on behalf of the proletariat. They did not imagine that the working people, once in power, would have need of a party as their</p>", "<p>9. Oil this see his Two Tactics of Social- 1.

The elevation of the doctrine of the proletarian dictatorship into the \u201cessence\u201d of Marxism, as Lenin later called it,<sup>2</sup> and the conception of this dictatorship as a state in which the ruling party would exercise tutelage over the working people, were a sign of his deep debt to the Russian populist revolutionary tradition. Leninism was in part a revival of Russian Jacobinism within Marxism. Lenin himself must have been well aware of this. It is less clear whether he was aware that indirectly, therefore, his outlook showed the influence of the Russian autocratic tradition that seemed, in 1917, to have reached its end.</p>", "<p>The First Decade</p>", "<p>Ulyanov moved to Petersburg in 1893, ostensibly to practice law but in fact to engage in socialist activity, and quickly acquired a certain reputation as a learned Marxist from the Volga.<sup>3</sup> Among those whom he.met in Marxist circles of the capital were two future Menshevik opponents, Julius Martov and Alexander Potresov, and his future wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, a young noblewoman involved in after-hours socialist activity while holding a clerical job in the railway administration.</p>", "<p>In early 1895, he went abroad for four months, going first to Switzerland, where he met and made a strong impression upon Plekhanov and the latter\u2019s associate P. B. Axelrod. On his return he undertook with Martov and others to organize a \u201cSt. Petersburg Union of Struggle for the Liberation of the Working Class.\u201d These efforts led to his (and Martov's) arrest at the end of 1895. After a year of imprisonment in Petersburg, he was sentenced to three years of exile in eastern Siberia. He and Krupskaya were married when she joined him there in 1898.<sup>4</sup> In July 1900, several months after -completing the term of exile, he went abroad again and entered the recently founded Russian Social-Democratic Workers' Party's leadership as one of the editors of Iskra (The Spark)\u2014a new foreign-based party organ that he himself had done much to organize. Except for his return to Russia during the insurrectionary turmoil of 1905-7, <sup>s</sup>he remained in emigration until 1917, living ihainly in Switzerland. Such are the unrevealing externals\u2019of his revolutionary biography.</p>", "<p>2.

Ulyanov\u2019s colossal capacity for work, combined with his powerful and prolific pen, brought him to the fore as a pamphleteer for revolutionary Marxism during that time of controversy between the populist and Marxist branches of the socialist movement,sand between militants and moderates within the Marxist branch. In 1894 he struck out at Pyotr Struve, a leading figure' among the so-called \u201cLegal Marxists,\u201d in a critique nearly as long as the book of Struve\u2019s it attacked; and he wrote a book-length polemical reply to an anti-Marxist article in a populist journal.<sup>5</sup> The polemic, entitled Who Are the \u201cFriends of the People** and How Do They Fight Against the SocialDemocrats?, went through three illegal hectographed editions and seven \u201cprintings\u201d between July and November 1894.<sup>6</sup></p>", "<p>Openly political socialist writings, not legally publishable under then-prevailing censorship' practices, would either be published abroad and smuggled back into Russia or, as \u2022 in this instance, duplicated and circulated clandestinely (a forerunner of the present-day samizdat, or \u201cself-publishing,\u201d as the circulation of uncensored writings in typescript'is called in Soviet Russia). Writings bf academic style and bulk, such as Struve\u2019s book and Ulyanov\u2019s long review of it, were publishable legally although various circumlocutions and code, words, known to the radicals as \u201cAesopian language,\u201d frequently had to be used. As an example, Plekhanov\u2019s influential book of 1895 on The Development of the Monist View of History came out legally in Russia. \u201cMonism\u201d was a code word for \u201cMarxism,\u201d and the author\u2019s name appeared as \u201cBeltov.\u201d Among the pen names that Ulyanov used during the first decade were \u201cIlyin,\u201d \u201cTulin,\u201d and \u201cLenin.\u201d Some have suggested that in using the latter his inspiration may have been the Lena, a river in eastern Siberia. \u201cLenin\u201d would thus carry the connotation of \u201cman from the Lena.\u201d Recent Soviet sources confirm this.</p>", "<p>The populist-Marxist debates of&lt;the nineties were dominated by other issues than those Plekhanov had raised against Russian Jacobinism in his works of the early eighties.

Now living abroad, Lavrov had recently questioned the possibility, of creating a workers\u2019 party in Russia without organizing \u201ca political conspiracy against absolutism\u201d in the tradition of the People\u2019s Will. Respectfully referring to him as \u201ca veteran of revolutionary theory,\u201d Lenin- rejected the idea of confining the revolutionary political struggle to a srfiall group\u2019s conspiracy to seize power The battle against absolutism should consist, he said, not in hatching plots but in training, disciplining, and organizing the workers, in propaganda and agitation among them. But save for its foctfs on* workers instead of peasants, this approach also formed a part, as Lenin well knew, of the populist heritage. So did his way of identifying \u201cabsolutism\u201d as the supreme enemy. After observing that bureaucracy (\u201ca special stratum of people specializing in government and placed in a privileged position vis-^-vis the people\u201d) existed everywhere, he remarked that nowhere was this institution so unchecked as in \u201cabsolutist, semi-Asiatic Russia.\u201d Consequently, not only the proletariat but many other elements of the people were arrayed against \u201cthe omnipotent, irresponsible, corrupt, savage, ignorant, and parasitic Russian bureaucracy.\u201d<sup>1</sup> It has been observed that one common characteristic of \u201cclassical populism\u201d in all its forms was the feeling that the \u201cRussian state of bureaucratic absolutism has been the primordial enemy of the popular masses and their intrinsic communal-socialist tendencies.\u2019.*<sup>2</sup></p>", "<p>In the editorial of the first issue of Iskra, published in December 1900, Lenin again underlined the cardinal importance pf practical organizational questions, and added: \u201cIn this respect we have lagged </p>", "<p>l.For The Tasks of 'the Russian\u2019Social-Democrats see pp. 3-1] below.</p>", "<p>2.

When it came time to adopt the party\u2019s rules, Lenin and Martov submitted different drafts of clause one, which defined the meaning of membership in the party.

It entered the Russian Social-Democratic Workers\u2019 Party at its founding congress in 1898, but subsequently withdrew.)

It breathed a spirit of revolutionary voluntarism, of confidence in the capacity of such a small *but well-organized elite of Marxist revolutionaries to build up an oppositional mass movement in Russian society and lead it to victory over the seemingly impregnable tsarist government. Most important of all, it prescribed in clear and definite terms that should be* done towards this end, and thus it pointed the way for Russian Marxists from revolutionary talk to revolutionary action, gave them a practical plan and tasks to perform.</p>", "<p>What was to be done, first of all, was to create the right kind of revolutionary party organization for Russia\u2019s special conditions. As if to reveal the inspiration that his plan drew from the populist tradition, Lenin devoted some glowing lines in this connection to the memory of \u201cthe magnificent organization which the revolutionaries had in the seventies, and which should serve us all as a model.\u201d He argued that the Russian Marxist party, unlike its counterparts in Germany and other freer countries in the West, should not seek a mass working-class membership, although it should strive to link itself with masses of workers and other discontented elements of society through party-infiltrated trade unions, study circles, and similar intermediate groups. To meet the needs of conspiratorial operation in the tsarist police state, the party should consist chiefly of persons trained in the art of revolutionary activity and prepared to make it their full-time occupation. It was of course this idea that underlay Lenin\u2019s draft: of clause one of the rules at the Second Congress. His and Martov\u2019s differing formulations on party membership were predicated upon differing conceptions of the party itself. But only one of these\u2014Lenin\u2019s\u2014was clearly thought out. '</p>", "<p>The theme of the pamphlet \"was the necessity of leadership for successful revolution. The party was conceived as a leadership group that would play an essential part in \u201cmaking\u201d the political revolution by giving ideological guidance to the masses and direct</p>", "<p>ing the revolutionary movement. In Lenin\u2019s Archimedean metaphor, <sup>44</sup>Give us an organization of revolutionaries, and we shall overturn the whole of Russia!\u201d If classical Marxism proclaimed the imminence of world proletarian revolution, Leninism (or \u201cMarxism-Leninism, \u201d as it became known in the Soviet Union after Lenin\u2019s death) originated in the proposition that there is no proletarian revolution except through the party. But it also advanced a further thesis: the leadership to be furnished by the elite party must be heroic in caliber. To be able to overturn the whole of Russia, the organization must consist of revolutionaries of special mold. SocialDemocrats should take as their ideal not the trade union secretary but the <sup>44</sup>tribune of the people, able to react to every manifestation of tyranny and oppression.\u201d They should be prepared to accomplish, as individuals, great revolutionary deeds. Lenin invoked the name of the German Social-Democratic leader Bebel and those of famous Russian populist revolutionaries of the seventies\u2014Alexeyev, Myshkin, Khalturin, and Zhelyabov\u2014to show what \u201cmiracles\u201d individuals could perform in the revolutionary cause.<sup>7</sup> Clearly, in taking the title of Chernyshevsky\u2019s What Is to Be Done? as his own, Lenin was saying that the contemporary struggle against 'tsarism had need of men like Rakhmetov.</p>", "<p>This call to revolutionary heroism sounded a new note in Russian Marxist writings. The historical role of individuals was one of the subjects of the earlier controversy with the populists: The latter contended that Marxist economic determinism precluded their opponents from recognizing the influence of great men upon historical events. The Marxists, for their part, accused the populists of disregarding class analysis of social phenomena in favor of a theory of \u201chero and crowd\u201d according to which historical progress issues from the impingement of outstanding individuals\u2019 thought upon the minds of the uncreative mass of humanity.

But in an effort to show how Marxism could take account of the \u201cparticle of truth\" in the great-man theory, Plekhanov allowed that individuals could make a mark upon history by accelerating the socioeconomically predetermined course of human development. \u201cA great man is great not because his personal quahties give individual features to great historical events,\" he explained, \u201cbut because he possesses qualities that make him most capable of serving the great social needs of his time/'<sup>0</sup> This became the generally accepted Russian Marxist position.</p>", "<p>Although Lenin did not directly take issue with it, his own outlook differed radically.

He too believed that only through organization is victory possible. He too wanted to organize a party of struggle for change whose influence would spread out in concentric circles from a nucleus of committed, energetic, and enlightened leaders\u2014in this case enlightened by Marxist theory. He too saw the social ills of the great, backward, bureaucratically misruled Russian Empire as sources of material suffering that made it possible lor the party of heroes to attract a mass following to' its banners.

There was no place in Plekhanovist thinking for an exuberant faith in the power of Social-Democratic Rakhme-tovs to work wonders in the revolutionary cause and thereby make history. Not surprisingly, Plekhanov charged that Lenin was reviving the old populist theory of heroes and the crowd, with the sole difference that Lenin's revolutionary heroes were to lead a proletarian rather than a peasant crowd. He explained the belatedness of his critical reaction to What-Is to Be Done? by saying that only after the Second Congress had it become clear to him what an \u201cenormous influence\" the pamphlet.was having upon the party's practical workers, and to what an extent it owed this influence to its very errors. \u201cLenin,\" he is also reported to have said, \u201cwrote a catechism for our practical workers, not a theoretical but a practical work, as a result of which many began to revere him and proclaim him a Social-Democratic Solomon.\u201d<sup>1</sup></p>", "<p>The older man\u2019s acid comment paid unwitting* tribute to the strength of Lenin's work, its electric appeal to many of the \u201cpractical workers\" in the movement.

In a letter of 1904 to a fellow Geor-'gian revolutionary living in' Leipzig, he unreservedly associated himself with Lenin's views and confessed that Lenin was his chosen leader. He scornfully dismissed Plekhanov\u2019s criticisms of What Is to Be Done?

As one member of the group put it': \u201cIlyich will show us all who he is. Just wait, just wait\u2014the day will come. Then everyone will see what a big, what a very big man he is.\u201d Despite his own enthusiasm for the leader, Valentinov was abashed at first by the almost religious \u201creverential atmosphere\u201d that surrounded Lenin in the colony. Then, little by little, he too became greatly enamored of Lenin: \u201cTo say that I Tell in love with him' would be a little comical, but this verb probably expresses best the attitude that I felt toward Lenin for many months.\u201d<sup>7</sup></p>", "<p>Not all the revolutionaries who came into direct contact with Lenin had this reaction, and among those who did there were some, like Valentinov himself, who later broke away and rejected Lenin as a mentor and leader. Yet it attests to the remarkable strength of Lenin's* magnetism that it at least temporarily drew into his orbit not only those who responded positively to his way of political thinking but even some whose tendency was to oppose'it. Martov, to cite a particularly significant example, is said to have \u201cfallen under the spell of Lenin's personality\u201d during the time of their collaboration as editors of Iskra, \u201cscarcely realizing whither he was being led.\u201d<sup>8 9</sup> Another fellow editor and subsequent Menshevik leader, Potresov, published much later a memoir that is remarkable both as a personal confession and as a diagnosis of Lenin's charismatic quality:</p>", "<p>No one could so fire others with his plans, no one could so impose his will and conquer by force of his personality as this seemingly so ordinary and somewhat coarse man who lacked any obvious sources of charm. . . . Neither Plekhanov nor Martov nor anyone else possessed the secret radiating from Lenin of positively-hypnotic effect tipon people\u2014I would even say, domination of them. Plekhanov was treated with deference, Martov was loved, but Lenin alone was followed unhesitatingly as the only indisputable leader. For only Lenin represented that rare phenomenon, especially rare in Russia, of a man of iron will and indomitable energy who combines fanatical faith in the movement, the cause, with no less faith in himself. If the French king, Louis XIV, could say, L'etat c\u2019est moi, Lenin, without putting it into wdrds, always had the feeling, Le parti cest moi, that in him the will of the movement was concentrated in one man. And he acted accordingly. I recall that Lenin's sense of mission to be the leader at one time made an impression upon me also.\u00ae</p>", "<p>7. Valentinov, Vstrechi, pp. 72-73, 75, 79.</p>", "<p>8.

Aside from the drivings physical energy and strength he exuded, the only physical attribute that particularly impressed others was his eyes, which were variously described as \u201cpenetrating,\u201d \u201cflashing,\u201d \u201call-seeing,\u201d \u201cunusual,\u201d and \u201cemitting little blue sparks in the comers.\u201d<sup>1</sup> He was, it is universally agreed, totally unpretentious in manner, a person of utmost directness and sincerity.</p>", "<p>It was on the speaker\u2019s platform that Lenin showed the special powers by virtue of which his followers set him apart from ordinary men. These were not gifts of brilliant oratory such as those for which Trotsky became famous. Lenin\u2019s speaking style was completely free of histrionics and striving for effect. Speaking in matter-of-fact tones, although articulately and with concentrated intensity, Lenin would launch directly into the subject at hand and present a clear, logically reasoned analysis replete with supporting facts. The effect upon his hsteners was often quite extraordinary. Over and over he demonstrated the power to raise his party audiences to a pitch of excitement, a veritable state of exaltation. Listening to his two speeches at the Bolshevik conference of 1905 in Tammerfors, for example, the normally reserved Stalin, like the rest of the company, was carried away. \u201cI was captivated by that irresistible force of logic in them which, although somewhat terse, thoroughly overpowered his audience, gradually electrified it, and then, as the saying goes, carried it away completely,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI remember that many of the delegates said: \u2018The logic of Lenin\u2019s speeches is like a mighty tentacle which seizes you on all sides as in a vise and from . whose grip you are powerless to tear yourself away: you must either surrender or make up your mind to utter defeat.' \u201d<sup>2</sup> Similar reminiscences abound in the memoir literature. To cite a vivid one, Max Eastman was moved to a state of \u201cPindaric rapture\u201d while watching Lenin speak in public for the next to last time, in November 1922, and afterwards described him in a note as \u201cthe most powerful <sub>t</sub>man I ever saw on the platform.\u201d Lenin appeared to him \u201ca granite mountain of sincerity\u201d of whom \u201cyou feel that he is all there for you\u2014you are receiving the whole of the man.\u201d It was as though a selfless intellectual had at last appeared on the scene of history, and \u201che was taking us inside his mind and showing us how the truth looks.\u201d<sup>3</sup></p>", "<p>1.

Not surprisingly, the genre in which he expressed himself to greatest effect was the lengthy pamphlet on the order of Whdt Is to Be Done? At intervals in the years after 1902, he produced a whole series of them: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back; Two Tactics of SocialDemocracy in the Democratic Revolution; The Right of Nations to Self-Determination; Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism; The State and Revolution; The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky; and \u201cLeft-Wing* Communism\u2014An Infantile Disorder. These pamphlet-treatises shaped the strategy and outlook of Bolshevism and were landmarks in its history. Although they contained many excursions into Marxist theory, basically they subordinated theoretical concerns to the practical needs and problems of the revolutionary movement. In this they continued the tendency of What Is to Be Done?, which made the Marxist theory of revolution into a theory of how to make a revolution. It might therefore be said that they elevated the practical needs and problems of the movement to the level of theory. Even in his one abstract philosophical treatise, Materialism and Empirio-criticism (1909), Lenin was preoccupied with practical needs of the movement as he perceived them, in this case with the need for a doctrinaire Marxist theory of the universe as an-ideological foundation; and, appropriately enough, one of the book\u2019s themes was the \u201cparty character\u201d of philosophy itself. Some Russian Marxist minds of speculative theoretical bent were repelled\". But this and other writings of Lenin exerted a hypnotic power over many others precisely because of the spirit of partisan practicality that permeated them.</p>", "<p>There shone through in Lenin's speeches and writings not dnly an inflexible will to revolution but a belief in it, a confidence that a socialist revolution would come about in Russia and that he and his followers would lead it. Potresov rightly pointed to this quality of revolutionary faith as a prime source of Lenin\u2019s charisma. To appreciate its full significance, we must recall how hard it was in the early years of the century for Russian* revolutionaries to preserve faith in the success of their cause. In Chekhov\u2019s Russia, as the poet Valery Briusov recalled in 1920, people like himself had pictured the revolution as a far-off event that they were not likely to see in their own lifetimes: \u201cNow, for example, there is talk of travel to other planets,.but few of us hope to see them. That is exactly how far away the Russian Revolution seemed to us then. To foresee that the Revolution was not so far away and that now-was the time to be moving towards it\u2014this was possible only for a man of colossal wisdom. And this is what astonishes me most of all in Lenin.\u201d<sup>4</sup></p>", "<p>4. Zhivoi Lenin, p. 238. Briusov gave the the occasion of Lenin's fiftieth birthday, speech in the Press Club in Moscow on</p>", "<p>Lenin had managed to communicate to people who yearned for socialist revolution without seriously expecting it a' feeling that such a revolution was a real possibility, and in doing this he was ministering to their deep-seated need for'confidence in their own commitment.</p>", "<p>It is true that the upheaval of 1^05 exposed the inner weakness of the monarchy behind its imposing facade of power, and showed that mass revolution was a potentiality in Russia. Bbt as this revolutionary wave receded and the tsarist regime consolidated itself; the rarik-and-file of the revolutionary parties deserted en masse. Many members of the radical intelligentsia began \u2019to' question the revolutionary beliefs by which they had lived. Russian Marxists showed a tendency to'renounce clandestine political activity, thereby succumbing to what Lenin saw as the heresy ofi \u201cliquidationism.\u201d The revolutionary movement as a whole experienced a period of disintegration, stagnation, and decline. And another time of severe trial ensued with the coming of the World War in 1914.</p>", "<p>Later testimony from prominent Bolsheviks suggests that Lenin\u2019s faith and fortitude during those times of adversity may have been of decisive importance for the Bolshevik movement. Stalin, for one, places great stress on Lenin\u2019s instilling of confidence in his dispirited Bolshevik followers after their defeat at the Stockholm \u2019\u2018Unity Congress\u201d in 1906 at the hands of a Menshevik majority. Defeat, he says, \u201ctransformed Lenin into a spring of compressed energy which inspired his followers for new battles and for future victory.\u201d He further recalls how the Bolshevik delegates huddled dejectedly together, gazing at Lenin and expressing discouragement, and how <sup>4</sup>\u2018Lenin bitingly replied through clenched teeth: \u2018Don\u2019t whine, comrades, we are bound to win, for we are right.\u2019 \u201d<sup>5</sup> Zinoviev, to take another example, gives\u2014from intimate personal memory\u2014the following account of Lenin\u2019s role during the ensuing \u201cdark era\u201d of counter-revolution: \u201cHe alone contrived to collect a close and intimate circle of fighters, whom he would cheer up by saying:\u2019\u2018Don\u2019t be disheartened; these dark days will pass, the muddy wave will ebb away; a few years will pass and we shall be\u2019bome on the crest of the wave, and the proletarian revolution will be bom again.\u2019 \u201d<sup>6</sup></p>", "<p>A significant strand in Lenin\u2019s revolutionary faith was belief in the imminence of socialist upheavals in Europe, and his visions of Russian revolution drgw added inspirational strength from a tendency to picture it as part of a larger, international revolutionary scene.-Already in What Is to Be Done? he envisaged the Russian proletariat making itself the \u201cvanguard of the international proletariat\u201d by overthrowing tsarism.

In the .ensuing anti-Bolshevik terror, he decided to go -into hiding, along with Zinoviev, so as to escape, probable, assassination.-In his absence, overall leadership of the. Bolsheviks in the capital devolved upon Trotsky, who only now, at long last, became a member of the Bolshevik Central Committee and fonAally merged hi$ small per-, sonal political following, the so-called Inter-Borough organization, with the Bolshevik Party. .Elected ptesident of the Petrograd Soviet (revolutionary,.council)-in September, Trotsky used this key position to carry out a series, of masterly political maneuvers in preparation for the events of late October. Meanwhile, his spellbindingoratory worked its effect upon the masses. As the climax drew near, he directed the organization of the armed rising and capture of power. When Lenin, reached the headquarters of the insurrection at the Smolny Institute on\u2018 the evening of October 24, he found opera-\u00ab tions proceeding swiftly and effectively under command of the MilP tary Revolutionary Committee, headed by-Trotsky. The followings evening, the Bolshevik leaders appeared before the Congress of Soviets,.meeting in the Smolny, to inaugurate the new regime. As John Reed describes the scene of Lenin's firs^ appearance on the rostrum, \u201che stood there waiting, apparently oblivious to the long-rolling ovation, which lasted several minutes.

From the beginning, when news of the first revolution reached, him in Switzerland, he grasped that a more radical Russian,revolution was possible. His political instinct informed him that the war-weary soldiers, discontented workers, and' land-hungry peasants would give increasing, support to a revolutionary party that appealed to them with slogans like \u201cPeace, Bread, and.Land\u2019* and \u201cAll Power to the Soviets!\u201d No sooner had 'he set foot on Russian soil than he unfolded in his \u201cApril Theses\u2019? a political strategy aiming at a more radical revolution.

Nor did his leadership of the Bolsheviks lapse when he went into hiding in July. While Trotsky took command in Petrograd, Lenin went on making the revolution in the familiar role of a writer.</p>", "<p>His essential contributioii was to nerve the Bolsheviks into making their decisive revolutionary move when the time came. This<sup>1 </sup>fundamental* concern inspired all of Lenin\u2019S writings and messages from his hiding-place. His seemingly theoretical treatise on The State and Revolution pursued a supremely practical end: to\u2019persuade the Bolsheviks (including, perhaps, himself) of the full Marxist legitimacy of taking power by force and violence and then setting up a \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat\u2019<sup>1</sup> which would suppress the bourgeoisie and other counter-revolutionary elements. His subsequent pamphlet, Can the Bolsheviks Retain State Power?, sought to quell doubts and refute the fearful thought that the party might not be able to hold onto political power if it succeeded in attaining it. If 130,000 landlords could rule Russia repressively after 1905, he argued, surely 240,000 Bolsheviks could rule it in the interests of 'the lowly, particularly if they took swift\u2019 steps to expand the social base of Bolshevik rule by enlisting millions of the poor in the everyday work of administration through such organizations as the Soviets.<sup>2</sup> In Marxism and Insurrection, a letter to the party written at the end of September, he maintained forcefolly that a Bolshevik victory was now assured, since all objective conditions existed for a successful insurrection: majority support for the Bolsheviks in both the Petrograd and Moscow Soviets, a nationwide rising revolutionary spirit\u2019 great vacillation in the ranks of the other parties, and the advantage of a party thabfirmly knew the path it must follow. Then, in a series of further messages in October, he virtually bludgeoned the party leaders into taking the historic decision despite the doubts that afflicted some and the objections of such prominent figures as Zinoviev'and Kamenev. \u201cWe must not wait! We may lose everything!\u201d he Exclaimed in a final appeal to the Central Committee written on October 24. \u201cHistory will not forgive revolutionaries for procrastinating when they could be victorious today (will certainly be victorious today), while they risk losing much, in fact, everything, tomorrow.\u201d<sup>3</sup></p>", "<p>Whether or-not the Bolshevik Revolution would have taken place without Lenin\u2019s leadership is one of those historical questions that people feel driven to-pose in spite of their ultimate insolubility. The opinion that Trotsky expressed in his diary in exile in 1935 is all the more significant since he himself was the one other individual</p>", "<p>2.

In the absence of both himself and Lenin, he reasoned, there would have been no October Revolution. In his own absence the Revolution would have taken place on condition that Lenin was present and in command. Without Lenin, however, he alone would probably not have been able to bring the irresolute Bolshevik leadership to the crucial decision.<sup>4 * </sup>Something similar had been said by Zinoviev many years earlier. Speaking before the Petrograd Soviet in 1918, shortly after the nearfatal attempt on Lenin\u2019s life by a former Socialist-Revolutionary, Fanya Kaplan, he said: \u201cThe October Revolution\u2014insofar as even in a revolution one may, and indeed, must speak of the role played by the individual\u2014the October Revolution and the part played in connection with it by our party are to the extent of nine-tenths the work of.Lenin.

One might argue, at the risk of some exaggeration, that it was in the role of revolutionary statesman that Lenin finally found his true element and demonstrated the full measure of his political genius. With that composed self-assurance which had characterized him from youthful years, he began his career in power by drafting and putting before the Congress of Soviets in the first hours the decrees on peace and land by which the new government established its revolutionary credentials and ringingly appealed for mass support in Russia and beyond its borders. Then he took charge of the beleaguered Bolshevik regime in its epic struggle to survive. No sooner had the Revolution been made than it needed to be defended, and its pros-</p>", "<p>4.

Isaac Deutscher summarizes as follows the point of view of the History. \u201cHis (i.e.,</p>", "<p>Lenin's] shrewdness, realism, and concentrated will emerge from the narrative as the decisive elements of the historic process, at least equal in importance to the spontaneous struggle of millions of workers and soldiers. If their energy was the 'steam' and the Bolshevik party the 'piston box* of the revolution, Lenin was the driver** (The Prophet Outcast: Trotsky. 1929-1940 [London, 1963], pp. 24041). Taking issue with Trotsky\u2019s view that Lenin's presence was a sine qua non of the October Revolution, Deutscher points out that this view ill accords with</p>", "<p>Trotsky's Marxist Weltanschauung, and adds that if it were true, \". . . then the leader cult at large would by ho mfeans be preposterous; and its denunciation by historical materialists, from Marx to Trotsky, and the revulsion of all progressive thought against, it would be pointless** (ibid., p. 244). That the view 111 .accords with Trotsky's Weltanschauung may speak against the Weltanschauung rather than against the view. Nor'is this view invalidated by the consideration that its acceptance would make the Lenin cult seem other than \u201cpreposterous.\u201d For an argument that Lenin's presence was decisive for the outcome of the Revolution, see Sidney Hook, The Hero in History (Boston, 1955), ch. X.</p>", "<p>5. Zinoviev, Speech to the Petrograd Soviet, p. 43.</p>", "<p>pects for salvation were unclear during the critical first two years of turmoil, civil war, and foreign intervention. At the outset, a German ultimatum in the peace talks that Trotsky conducted at Brest-Litovsk plunged Lenin's regime into a grave, crisis that was both external and internal. Overcoming the opposition of Bukharin and others in a \u201cLeft Communist*\u2019 faction that was calling for revolutionary war, he finally forced through an acceptance of the German terms in the hope of trading space for time, a policy subsequently vindicated by events. On this ground alone, some Bolsheviks came to regard him not only as the sine qua non of the Revolution but its savior as well. Needless to add, Lenin had no monopoly upon heroic leadership of the Bolshevik cause during the revolutionary period. Many others rendered exceptional service in saving the Revolution and constructing the new Soviet order. It is particularly noteworthy that Trotsky rose to great heights as the organizer of the Red Army and chief manager of its operations on the far-flung fronts of the Civil War.</p>", "<p>The Leader in Power</p>", "<p>In deviation from the historic pattern of Russian autocracy, the Soviet Russian state arose as a novel form of party rule. Political power in the one-party system was vested in collective bodies such as the Party Congress, which met annually in the early years, and its elected interim surrogate, the Central Committee. Yet, the revolutionary party dictatorship had in Lenin an acknowledged individual supreme leader of such pre-eminence that it could properly be described as a \u201cLenin regime.\u201d What was the nature, of his role as leader, and on what basis did he exercise his great authority?</p>", "<p>It was not on the basis of his tenure of a particular office. Indeed, no office of supreme leader was established in the Soviet system*. True, Leniif held the premiership. He\u2019 was chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, the central Soviet government. But it was the higher party organs, notably the Central Committee and its subcommittee, the Politburo, that decided Soviet policy in both internal and external affairs, and the government evolved as the party\u2019s main executive agency. Lenin was an advocate of this arrangement and took care to uphold it in practice. In 1923, he praised the established procedure under which foreign-policy moves were decided in the Politburo for implementation by the Foreign Affairs Commissariat, and held up this \u201cflexible amalgamation\u201d' of party and government institutions as a model of the way in which the Soviet party-state ought to function.<sup>6</sup> There were instances in</p>", "<p>6. See Better Fewer, But Better, pp. 734\u201446, below.</p>", "<p>which he would resolve ^differences between himself and a subordinate government leader not by invoking his superior power as premier but rather by referring the disputed issue to the Politburo for decision by a majority vote. It must be stressed, though, that he gave strong leadership in his role as presiding officer in the government. A participant in session^ of the-Council of People\u2019s Commissars later recalled: \u201cLenin &gt;vas not merely a chairman but a recognized chief to whom everyone brought his thorny problems. The commissars quarreled among themselves in their daily work, but here Lenin had the last word; and all alike left these meetings reassured, as though their quarrels had been those of children now pacified by a wise parent.\u201d<sup>7</sup></p>", "<p>Since the party was the ruling political authority in the Soviet state, it Was not as chief of government but as head of the party that Lenin acted as supreme leader. On the party side, however, his primacy was not institutionalized ih a' post corresponding to the premiership in the government. Officially he was merely one of the members-of the higher party organs: the Central Committee, which in the early twenties had about twenty-five full members and fifteen or so non-voting candidate members, and the Politburo. The latter in 1922 had a membership of ten (Lenin, Trotsky, Kamenev, Zinoviev; Stalin, Alexei Rykov, and Mikhail Tomsky, with Bukharin, M. I. Kahnin, and Viacheslav Molotov as candidate members). In filling out a questionnaire as a delegate to the Tenth Party Congress only a year earlier, Lenin gave his party office as \u201cmember of the Central Committee.\u201d<sup>8</sup></p>", "<p>The CentrafCommittee, like the Politburo, operated as a collegial Body, taking decisions by majority tote. In neither was Leriin chairman. Formally, he was on a par with the other full members; his vote counted for no more than theirs. There was a great discrepancy, however, between the formality and 'the reality of his position in these pOhcy-making bodies. In fact he was the dominant individual and his influence was very great.

The acceptance of Lenin\u2019s authority did not mean that the other leaders were indisposed to disagree with him or oppose him on specific policy questions. As supreme leader, he did not simply issue commands to the ruling group; he did not rule by arbitrary Diktat. Automatic acquiescence in his position was not expected; the whole previous * history of Bolshevik leadership politics militated against any such dictatorial relationship of the leader to his followers. It was not that Lenin hesitated to impose his views or was easily given to compromise when his position and that of his followers diverged, as happened rather frequently. On the contrary, he was a strong-willed and very self-confident leader who repeatedly set himself, against the main current of party opinion in questions of revolutionary strategy and politics. He did not compromise with those who opposed him on matters that he deemed of critical importance for the movement. The point is that the powers on which he chiefly relied in exercising this forceful individual leadership were his powers of persuasion. It was so in the long preparatory period before Bolshevism came to power, and it remained so after the Bolshevik Revolution'.</p>", "<p>Lenin\u2019s ascendancy is illustrated by the military debate at the Eighth Party Congress in March 1919. In closed session, powerful forces in the Bolshevik leadership mounted a determined attack upon the military policy of Trotsky, who had left Moscow before the debate in order to direct operations against Admiral Kolchak\u2019s forces, on the eastern front. The defeat of this military opposition became a foregone conclusion, however, when Lenin put in a strong plea on Trotsky\u2019s behalf; so much so that Lenin did not even remain at the congress to await the outcome.\u00ae Again, the ill-fated decision of July 1920 to launch the Red Army on an invasion of Poland\u2014a decision for which Lenin himself was largely responsible\u2014did not even shake his commanding authority in the party, although the results proved disastrous. As Zinoviev remarked at the Thirteenth Party Congress, some months after Lenin\u2019s death* no one but Lenin would have been able to go before a Party Congress (as he did in March 1921) and confess responsibility for such an error with complete political impunity.<sup>1</sup> Finally, it may.be noted that Lenin, without holding office in the Communist International, dominated its decisions through his personal influence over the Russian representatives who gave leadership to the organization.

I\u2019ll admit even today that his position was the result of his undoubted superiority.\u201d<sup>2</sup></p>", "<p>How was Lenin able to dominate the party without being an allpowerful chief executive who could give orders to its leading organs? Some might explain it by the prestige accruing to him as the one who had founded the Bolshevik Party and accomplished the astounding feat of leading it to power in the Revolution of 1917. Although not without merit, such an explanation can scarcely be accepted as adequate. For it leaves open the question of how he acquired his authority in the beginning and how he held onto it at the end; and hete we must recall that the prestige of many an historical leader has declined&gt; very quickly after reaching its peak. In the final analysis, Lenin\u2019s phenomenal authority in the party derived from his extraordinary qualities as a revolutionary leader and political personality. We may express this in terms suggested earlier by saying that he conformed to Weber\u2019s conception of the charismatic leader who enjoys his authority not through enacted position or traditional dignity but owing Ip gifts of grace (charisma) \u201cby virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers or qualities\u201d (the \u201csupernatural\u201d and \u201csuperhuman\u201d being excluded in this instance,)<sup>3</sup> Alternatively, we may refer back to words that Lenin used in 1902 in a \u201cLetter to a Comrade on Our,Organizational Tasks.\u201d After describing the kind of revolutionary organization that\u2019 his plan envisaged, he declared that its task was to \u201cpreserve.leadership of the whole movement, preserving it, of course, not by force of power but by force of authority, by force of energy, by greater experience, greater versatility, and .greater talentedness.\u201d<sup>4</sup> This formula for the'party\u2019s preservation of its leadership of the mass movement may be taken as a fair description of how Lenin himself preserved leadership of the party during the following two decades.</p>", "<p>He was the veritable hub of the Bolshevik regime in the five years of active life remaining to him after the taking of power.

In March 1921\u2014a time of profound crisis for the Revolution\u2014he sponsored one of those abrupt and far-reaching shifts of line by which his political style was characterized. The White armies had been defeated by then, but inside the weary and war-torn country the peasants were vocally and in places violently in revolt against the forcible grain requisitions to which the beleaguered regime had regularly resorted under \"War Communism?<sup>1</sup> While the Tenth Party Congress was \u201cin session in, Moscow, sailors and workers at the Kronstadt naval base, on an island outside Petrograd harbor, rose in armed rebellion and issued inflammatory appeals, like \"Soviets without Bolsheviks!\u201d The rising was crushed by the Red Army, but its political implications were taken into account by the Lenin regime. Under his leadership the Tenth Congress inaugurated the \"New Economic Pohcy\u201d (NEP) by, abolishing forcible.grain requisitions in favor of a graduated' tax in kind \u2018on' the peasant proprietors of the approximately twenty-five million small private farms then existing in Russia.

He came to appear the very personification of the miracle of their survival in power, and of the further promise of the Communist revolution at home and abroad. Not only by close associates but by great* numbers of party members he was not simply admired but quite literally\u2018idolized. The strongest evidence of this is the testimony of those who observed party audiences on occasions when he spoke in public. One such\u2018report comes from Walter Duranty: \u201cI have seen Lenin speak, to his followers. A'small, busy, thick-set man under blinding lights, greeted by applause dike thunder. I turned round and their faces were shining, like men who looked on God. Lenin was like that, whether you think*he was a damnable* Antichrist or a once-in-a-thousand years\u2019 prophet. That is a matter of opinion, but when five thousand faces can light up and shine at the sight of him, as 'they did, and I saw it, then I say he'was no ordinary,individual.\u201d<sup>7 </sup>Similar reports abound in the memoir literature. \u201cTheir faces shone,\u201d said a Russian Communist who was in the audience at One of Lenin's post-revolutionary,public speeches.. \u201cIt was truly an intellectual revel.\u201d<sup>8</sup> Ignazio Silone, who first saw\u2019Lenin at the Comintern congress in Moscow in 1921, recalls that \u201cwhenever l?e came into the hall, the atmosphere changed, became electric.

Trotsky, who in later years was to condemn the cult of Lenin, declared in a speech of September 2, 1918, to the Executive Committee of the Soviets: \u201cNever has the individual life of-one or another among us seemed to be of such secondary importance as it does now at a moment when the life'of &lt;the greatest man of*, our age is in peril.

Sol\u2019ts portrayed him as a new kind of hero in history, a leader of consciously acting masses whose need was no longer for a hero to whom they could bow but for one who was, like Lenin, \u201cflesh of their flesh, thought, and word.\u201d Trotsky described Lenin as a blend of Marxist internationalist and Russian revolutionary statesman with \u201csomething about him that is strongly,suggestive of a peasant.\u201d Since Russia had never experienced a great revolution or reformation at the hands of its bourgeoisie, Trotsky said, its national revolution had devolved upon the working class, led by Lenin: \u201cOur historical past knows neither a Luther, nor a Thomas Miinzer, neither.a Mirabeau, nor a Robespierre. For that very reason the Russian proletariat has its Lenin.\u201d Bukharin paid tribute to Lenin as a teacher who had developed a new theoretical school of Marxism, and on this account spoke of the other \u2022 party leaders as his \u201cdisciples.\u201d Stalin, who was one of the last to speak at the meeting, commented that the others had left him with little to say and then devoted his remarks to the modesty of Lenin, recounting two episodes in which \u201cthat giant\u201d had erred \u2022 (one was in not having wanted to await the convening of the Congress of Soviets in October 1917 before launching the coup) and later courageously admitted erring. But in his Pravda article for the occasion, Stalin offered a general assessment of Lenin as the \u201corganizer and vozhd\u2019 \u201d of the Russian Communist Party. He concluded by contrasting Lenin with two lesser types of proletarian leaders known -to history \u2014those who were outstanding practical leaders in times of stress but weak in theory, like Lassalle and Blanqui, and those who were strong in theory but weak in organizational and practical work, like Plekhanov and Kautsky.

Then he pointedly expressed the hope that in tim&amp; a \"more fitting\u201d way of marking anniversary dates would be found, and he concluded his talk with a discussion of routine party problems.

But what was the relation of the masses of non-party people in Russia to Lenin as a political leader? We know that Russian workers and peasants who met'him individually or in small groups felt the magnetic spell of his personality. For example, M. A. Landau-Aldanov, a Russian socialist who was politically opposed to Lenin, tells the following story of a worker who spoke briefly with him on the occasion of delivering a message: \"I saw this workman at the moment when he returned from his audience with Lenin. He was powerfully moved, not the same man.

What can be said with confidence is that, despite the low development of the modem communications media in Russia at that time, Lenin as a personality made a very strong impression upon the masses of people and aroused passionate feelings\u2014both positive and negative. The ambivalence of attitudes arose from the fact that ordinary Russians, aided by the old habit of personifying political power in the tsar, tended to see in Lenin the personification of Bolshevism, towards which feelings in the populace were deeply divided in the revolutionary period.
