[{"content": "<p class=\"noind\">[1]. The notion that Marxism has its foundation in \u201cdialectical materialism,\u201d a general world-view of which historical materialism is the application to human history, is a later growth particularly associated with Russian and subsequently Communist Marxism, and is not the classical Marxist position. For Marx the prime subject of Marxism was human history, hence historical materialism was the foundation of the teaching. Moreover, historical materialism was itself dialectical in that the human historical process showed a revolutionary pattern of development through opposition and conflict. To this it must be added that Engels, who more than Marx was interested in the progress of natural science in the nineteenth century, did give an initial impetus to the later emergence of a Marxist \u201cdialectical materialism\u201d by his speculations on the presence of dialectical laws in natural processes. He began but never completed a book on this subject, the manuscript of which was first published in the twentieth century under the title \u201cDialectics of Nature\u201d. The term \u201cdialectical materialism\u201d was put into currency by the Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov in one of his writings of the late nineteenth century. For a long while the authoritative version of the viewpoint of Communist Marxism on this subject was the essay by Joseph Stalin, \u201cDialectical and Historical Materialism,\u201d published as a part of Chapter Four of the \u201cHistory of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks).
