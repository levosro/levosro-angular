In the year 1842-43, as editor of the <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i>, I first found myself in the embarrassing position of having to discuss what is known as material interests. The deliberations of the Rhine Province Assembly in thefts of wood and the division of landed property; the official polemic started by Herr von Schaper, then Oberpr\u00e4sident of the Rhine Province, against the <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i> about the condition of the Mosel peasantry, and finally the debates on free trade and protective tariffs caused me in the first instance to turn my attention to economic questions. [A reference to the articles \u201cProceedings of the Sixth Rhine Province Assembly. Third article. Debates on the Law of Thefts of Wood\u201d, \u201cPolemical Articles Against the <i>Allgemeine Zeitung\u201d</i> and \u201cJustification of the Correspondent from the Mosel\u201d.] On the other hand, at that time when good intentions \u201cto push forward\u201d often took the place of factual knowledge, an echo of French socialism and communism, slightly tinged by philosophy, was noticeable in the <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i>. I objected to this dilettantism, but at the same time frankly admitted in a controversy with the <i>Allgemeine Augsburger Zeitung</i> [See \u201cCommunism and the Augsburg <i>Allgemeine Zeitung\u201d</i>.] that my previous studies did not allow me to express any opinion on the content of the French theories. When the publishers of the <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i> conceived the illusion that by a more compliant policy on the part of the paper it might be possible to secure the abrogation of the death sentence passed upon it, I eagerly grasped the opportunity to withdraw from the public stage to my study.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p2\"></a>The first work which I undertook to dispel the doubts assailing me was a critical re-examination of the Hegelian philosophy of law; the introduction [See \u201cContribution to the Critique of Hegel\u2019s Philosophy of Law\u201d and \u201cContribution to the Critique of Hegel\u2019s Philosophy of Law. Introduction\u201d.] to this work being published in the <i>Deutsch-Franz\u00f6sische Jahrb\u00fccher</i> issued in Paris in 1844. My inquiry led me to the conclusion that neither legal relations nor political forms could be comprehended whether by themselves or on the basis of a so-called general development of the human mind, but that on the contrary they originate in the material conditions of life, the totality of which Hegel, following the example of English and French thinkers of the eighteenth century, embraces within the term \u201ccivil society\u201d; that the anatomy of this civil society, however, has to be sought in political economy. The study of this, which I began in Paris, I continued in Brussels, where I moved owing to an expulsion order issued by M. Guizot. The general conclusion at which I arrived and which, once reached, became the guiding principle of my studies can be summarised as follows. In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or \u2014 this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms \u2014 with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure. In studying such transformations it is always necessary to distinguish between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, artistic or philosophic \u2014 in short, ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out. Just as one does not judge an individual by what he thinks about himself, so one cannot judge such a period of transformation by its consciousness, but, on the contrary, this consciousness must be explained from the contradictions of material life, from the conflict existing between the social forces of production and the relations of production. No social formation is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society. Mankind thus inevitably sets itself only such tasks as it is able to solve, since closer examination will always show that the problem itself arises only when the material conditions for its solution are already present or at least in the course of formation. In broad outline, the Asiatic, ancient, feudal and modern bourgeois modes of production may be designated as epochs marking progress in the economic development of society. The bourgeois relations of production are the last antagonistic form of the social process of production \u2014 antagonistic not in the sense of individual antagonism but of an antagonism that emanates from the individuals\u2019 social conditions of existence \u2014 but the productive forces developing within bourgeois society create also the material conditions for a solution of this antagonism. The prehistory of human society accordingly closes with this social formation.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>Frederick Engels, with whom I maintained a constant exchange of ideas by correspondence since the publication of his brilliant essay on the critique of economic categories [F. Engels, \u201cOutlines of a Critique of Political Economy\u201d.] (printed in the <i>Deutsch-Franz\u00f6sische Jahrb\u00fccher</i>), arrived by another road (compare his <i>Condition of the Working-Class in England)</i> at the same result as I, and when in the spring of 1845 he too came to live in Brussels, we decided to set forth together our conception as opposed to the ideological one of German philosophy, in fact to settle accounts with our former philosophical conscience. The intention was carried out in the form of a critique of post-Hegelian philosophy. The manuscript, two large octavo volumes, had long ago reached the publishers in Westphalia when we were informed that owing to changed circumstances it could not be printed. We abandoned the manuscript to the gnawing criticism of the mice all the more willingly since we had achieved our main purpose \u2014 self-clarification. Of the scattered works in which at that time we presented one or another aspect of our views to the public, I shall mention only the <i>Manifesto of the Communist Party</i>, jointly written by Engels and myself, and a <i>Speech on the Question of Free Trade</i>, which I myself published. The salient points of our conception were first outlined in an academic, although polemical, form in my <i>Poverty of Philosophy</i>..., this book which was aimed at Proudhon appeared in 1847. The publication of an essay on <i>Wage-Labour</i> written in German in which I combined the lectures I had held on this subject at the German Workers\u2019 Society in Brussels, was interrupted by the February Revolution and my forcible removal from Belgium in consequence.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>The publication of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> in 1848 and 1849 and subsequent events cut short my economic studies, which I could only resume in London in 1850. The enormous amount of material relating to the history of political economy assembled in the British Museum, the fact that London is a convenient vantage point for the observation of bourgeois society, and finally the new stage of development which this society seemed to have entered with the discovery of gold in California and Australia, induced me to start again from the very beginning and to work carefully through the new material. These studies led partly of their own accord to apparently quite remote subjects on which I had to spend a certain amount of time. But it was in particular the imperative necessity of earning my living which reduced the time at my disposal. My collaboration, continued now for eight years, with the <i>New York Tribune</i>, the leading Anglo-American newspaper, necessitated an excessive fragmentation of my studies, for I wrote only exceptionally newspaper correspondence in the strict sense. Since a considerable part of my contributions consisted of articles dealing with important economic events in Britain and on the Continent, I was compelled to become conversant with practical details which, strictly speaking, lie outside the sphere of political economy.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>This sketch of the course of my studies in the domain of political economy is intended merely to show that my views \u2014 no matter how they may be judged and how little they conform to the interested prejudices of the ruling classes \u2014 are the outcome of conscientious research carried on over many years.

(From a philosophical point of view, however, it is important to specify these aspects better, since from the specific manner of this turn we can reason back towards the immanent determination and the universal historic character of a philosophy. We see here, as it were, its <i>curriculum vitae</i> [course of life] narrowed down to its subjective point.) But the <i>practice</i> of philosophy is itself <i>theoretical</i>. It is the <i>critique</i> that measures the individual existence by the essence, the particular reality by the Idea. But this <i>immediate realisation</i> of philosophy is in its deepest essence afflicted with contradictions, and this its essence takes form in the appearance and imprints its seal upon it.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>When philosophy turns itself as will against the world of appearance, then the system is lowered to an abstract totality, that is, it has become one aspect of the world which opposes another one. Its relationship to the world is that of reflection. Inspired by the urge to realise itself, it enters into tension against the other. The inner self-contentment and completeness has been broken. What was inner light has become consuming flame turning outwards. The result is that as the world becomes philosophical, philosophy also becomes worldly, that its realisation is also its loss, that what it struggles against on the outside is its own inner deficiency, that in the very struggle it falls precisely into those defects which it fights as defects in the opposite camp, and that it can only overcome these defects by falling into them. That which opposes it and that which it fights is always the same as itself, only with factors inverted.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>This is the one side, when we consider this matter <i>purely objectively</i> as immediate realisation of philosophy. However, it has also a <i>subjective</i> aspect, which is merely another form of it. This is <i>the relationship of the philosophical system</i> which is realised <i>to its intellectual carriers</i>, to the individual self-consciousnesses in which its progress appears. This relationship results in what confronts the world in the realisation of philosophy itself, namely, in the fact that these individual self-consciousnesses always carry <i>a double-edged demand</i>, one edge turned against the world, the other against philosophy itself. Indeed, what in the thing itself appears as a relationship inverted in itself, appears in these self-consciousnesses as a double one, a demand and an action contradicting each other. Their liberation of the world from un-philosophy is at the same time their own liberation from the philosophy that held them in fetters as a particular system.</p>", "<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p6\"></a>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"stea\"><b>***</b></span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>As in the history of philosophy there are nodal points which raise philosophy in itself to concretion, apprehend abstract principles in a totality, and thus break off the rectilinear process, so also there are moments when philosophy turns its eyes to the external world, and no longer apprehends it, but, as a practical person, weaves, as it were, intrigues with the world, emerges from the transparent kingdom of Amenthes and throws itself on the breast of the worldly Siren. That is the carnival of philosophy, whether it disguises itself as a dog like the Cynic, in priestly vestments like the Alexandrian, or in fragrant spring array like the Epicurean. It is essential that philosophy should then wear character masks. As Deucalion, according to the legend, cast stones behind him in creating human beings, so philosophy casts its regard behind it (the bones of its mother are luminous eyes) when its heart is set on creating a world; but as Prometheus, having stolen fire from heaven, begins to build houses and to settle upon the earth, so philosophy, expanded to be the whole world, turns against the world of appearance.

The division of the world is total only when its aspects are totalities. The world confronting a philosophy total in itself is therefore a world torn apart. This philosophy\u2019s activity therefore also appears torn apart and contradictory; its objective universality is turned back into the subjective forms of individual consciousness in which it has life.

It therefore becomes increasingly obvious that a new rallying point must be sought for truly thinking and independent minds.

Hence I have no doubt about the enterprise, if it is undertaken seriously.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>The internal difficulties seem to be almost greater than the external obstacles. For although no doubt exists on the question of \u201cWhence\u201d, all the greater confusion prevails on the question of \u201cWhither\u201d. Not only has a state of general anarchy set in among the reformers, but everyone will have to admit to himself that he has no exact idea what the future ought to be. On the other hand, it is precisely the advantage of the new trend that we do not dogmatically anticipate the world, but only want to find the new world through criticism of the old one. Hitherto philosophers have had the solution of all riddles lying in their writing-desks, and the stupid, exoteric world had only to open its mouth for the roast pigeons of absolute knowledge to fly into it. Now philosophy has become mundane, and the most striking proof of this is that philosophical consciousness itself has been drawn into the torment of the struggle, not only externally but also internally. But, if constructing the future and settling everything for all times are not our affair, it is all the more clear what we have to accomplish at present: I am referring to <i>ruthless criticism of all that exists</i>, ruthless both in the sense of not being afraid of the results it arrives at and in the sense of being just as little afraid of conflict with the powers that be.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>Therefore I am not in favour of raising any dogmatic banner. On the contrary, we must try to help the dogmatists to clarify their propositions for themselves. Thus, <i>communism</i>, in particular, is a dogmatic abstraction; in which connection, however, I am not thinking of some imaginary and possible communism, but actually existing communism as taught by Cabet, D\u00e9zamy, Weitling, etc. This communism is itself only a special expression of the humanistic principle, an expression which is still infected by its antithesis \u2014 the private system. Hence the abolition of private property and communism are by no means identical, and it is not accidental but inevitable that communism has seen other socialist doctrines \u2014 such as those of Fourier, Proudhon, etc. \u2014 arising to confront it because it is itself only a special, one-sided realisation of the socialist principle.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>And the whole socialist principle in its turn is only one aspect that concerns the <i>reality</i> of the true human being. But we have to pay just as much attention to the other aspect, to the theoretical existence of man, and therefore to make religion, science, etc., the object of our criticism. In addition, we want to influence our contemporaries, particularly our German contemporaries. The question arises: how are we to set about it? There are two kinds of facts which are undeniable. In the first place religion, and next to it, politics, are the subjects which form the main interest of Germany today. We must take these, in whatever form they exist, as our point of departure, and not confront them with some ready-made system such as, for example, the <i>Voyage en Icarie</i>. [\u00c9tienne Cabet, <i>Voyage en Icarie. Roman philosophique el social</i>.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>Reason has always existed, but not always in a reasonable form. The critic can therefore start out from any form of theoretical and practical consciousness and from the forms <i>peculiar</i> to existing reality develop the true reality as its obligation and its final goal. As far as real life is concerned, it is precisely the <i>political state</i> \u2014 in all its <i>modern</i> forms \u2014 which, even where it is not yet consciously imbued with socialist demands, contains the demands of reason. And the political state does not stop there. Everywhere it assumes that reason has been realised. But precisely because of that it everywhere becomes involved in the contradiction between its ideal function and its real prerequisites.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>From this conflict of the political state with itself, therefore, it is possible everywhere to develop the social truth. Just as <i>religion</i> is a register of the theoretical struggles of mankind, so the <i>political state</i> is a register of the practical struggles of mankind. Thus, the political state expresses, within the limits of its form <i>sub specie rei publicae</i> [as a particular kind of state], all social struggles, needs and truths. Therefore, to take as the object of criticism a most specialised political question \u2014 such as the difference between a system based on social estate and one based on representation \u2014 is in no way below the <i>hauteur des principes</i> [level of principles]. For this question only expresses in a <i>political</i> way the difference between rule by man and rule by private property. Therefore the critic not only can, but must deal with these political questions (which according to the extreme Socialists are altogether unworthy of attention). In analysing the superiority of the representative system over the social-estate system, the critic <i>in a practical way wins the interest</i> of a large party. By raising the representative system from its political form to the universal form and by bringing out the true significance underlying this system, the critic at the same time compels this party to go beyond its own confines, for its victory is at the same time its defeat.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p10\"></a>Hence, nothing prevents us from making criticism of politics, participation in politics, and therefore <i>real</i> struggles, the starting point of our criticism, and from identifying our criticism with them. In that case we do not confront the world in a doctrinaire way with a new principle: Here is the truth, kneel down before it! We develop new principles for the world out of the world\u2019s own principles. We do not say to the world: Cease your struggles, they are foolish; we will give you the true slogan of struggle. We merely show the world what it is really fighting for, and consciousness is something that it <i>has</i> to acquire, even if it does not want to.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p11\"></a>The reform of consciousness consists <i>only</i> in making the world aware of its own consciousness, in awakening it out of its dream about itself, in <i>explaining</i> to it the meaning of its own actions. Our whole object can only be \u2014 as is also the case in Feuerbach\u2019s criticism of religion \u2014 to give religious and philosophical questions the form corresponding to man who has become conscious of himself.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p12\"></a>Hence, our motto must be: reform of consciousness not through dogmas, but by analysing the mystical consciousness that is unintelligible to itself, whether it manifests itself in a religious or a political form. It will then become evident that the world has long dreamed of possessing something of which it has only to be conscious in order to possess it in reality.

Family and civil society are actual components of the state, actual spiritual existences of the will; they are modes of existence of the state. Family and civil society constitute <i>themselves</i> as the state. They are the driving force. According to Hegel, they are on the contrary <i>produced</i> by the actual idea. It is not the course of their own life which unites them in the state; on the contrary, it is the idea which in the course of its life has separated them off from itself. Indeed, they are the finiteness of this idea. They owe their presence to another mind than their own. They are entities determined by a third party, not self-determined entities. Accordingly, they are also defined as \u201cfiniteness\u201d, as the \u201cactual idea\u2019s\u201d own finiteness. The purpose of their being is not this being itself; rather, the idea separates these presuppositions off from itself \u201cso as to emerge from their ideality as explicitly infinite actual mind\u201d. That is to say, there can be no political state without the natural basis of the family and the artificial basis of civil society; they are for it a <i>conditio sine qua non</i>. But the condition is postulated as the conditioned, the determinant as the determined, the producing factor as the product of its product.

In monarchy one part determines the character of the whole. The entire constitution has to adapt itself to this fixed point. Democracy is the genus Constitution.

Just as it is not religion which creates man but man who creates religion, so it is not the constitution which creates the people but the people which creates the constitution.

Democracy stands to the other constitutions as the genus stands to its species; except that here the genus itself appears as an existent, and therefore as one particular species over against the others whose existence does not correspond to their essence. To democracy all other forms of state stand as its Old Testament. Man does not exist for the law but the law for man \u2014 it is a <i>human manifestation;</i> whereas in the other forms of state man is a <i>legal manifestation</i>. That is the fundamental distinction of democracy.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>All other <i>state forms</i> are definite, distinct, <i>particular forms of state</i>. In democracy the <i>formal</i> principle is at the same time the <i>material</i> principle. Only democracy, therefore, is the true unity of the general and the particular. In monarchy, for example, and in the republic as a merely particular form of state, political man has his particular mode of being alongside unpolitical man, man as a private individual. Property, contract, marriage, civil society, all appear here (as Hegel shows quite correctly with regard to these <i>abstract</i> state forms, but he <i>thinks</i> that he is expounding the idea of the state) as <i>particular</i> modes of existence alongside the <i>political</i> state, as the <i>content</i> to which the <i>political state</i> is related as <i>organising form:</i> properly speaking, the relation of the political state to this content is merely that of reason, inherently without content, which defines and delimits, which now affirms and now denies. In democracy the political state, which stands alongside this content and distinguishes itself from it, is itself merely a <i>particular</i> content and particular <i>form of existence</i> of the people. In monarchy, for example, this particular, the political constitution, has the significance of the <i>general</i> that dominates and determines everything particular. In democracy the state as particular is <i>merely</i> particular; as general, it is the truly general, i.e., not something determinate in distinction from the other content.

Hegel is right, therefore, when he says: The political state is the constitution, i.e., the material state is not political. What obtains here is merely an external identity, a determination of changing forms. Of the various elements of national life, the one most difficult to evolve was the political state, the constitution. It developed as universal reason over against the other spheres, as ulterior to them. The historical task then consisted in its [the constitution\u2019s] reassertion, but the particular spheres do not realise that their private nature coincides with the other-worldly nature of the constitution or of the political state, and that the other-worldly existence of the political state is nothing but the affirmation of their own estrangement. Up till now the <i>political constitution</i> has been the <i>religious sphere</i>, the <i>religion</i> of national life, the heaven of its generality over against the <i>earthly existence</i> of its actuality. The political sphere has been the only state sphere in the state, the only sphere in which the content as well as the form has been species-content, the truly general; but in such a way that at the same time, because this sphere has confronted the others, its content has also become formal and particular. <i>Political life</i> in the modern sense is the <i>scholasticism</i> of national life. <i>Monarchy</i> is the perfect expression of this estrangement. The <i>republic</i> is the negation of this estrangement within its own sphere. It is obvious that the political constitution as such is brought into being only where the private spheres have won an independent existence. Where trade and landed property are not free and have not yet become independent, the political constitution too does not yet exist.

In the Middle Ages the political constitution is the constitution of private property, but only because the constitution of private property is a political constitution. In the Middle Ages the life of the nation and the life of the state are identical. Man is the actual principle of the state \u2014 but <i>unfree</i> man. It is thus the <i>democracy of unfreedom</i> \u2014 estrangement carried to completion. The abstract reflected antithesis belongs only to the modern world.

It is therefore obliged to pass off the form for the content and the content for the form. State objectives are transformed into objectives of the department, and department objectives into objectives of the state. The bureaucracy is a circle from which no one can escape.

The bureaucracy has the state, the spiritual essence of society, in its possession, as its <i>private property</i>. The general spirit of the bureaucracy is the <i>secret</i>, the mystery, preserved within itself by the hierarchy and against the outside world by being a closed corporation. Avowed political spirit, as also political-mindedness, therefore appear to the bureaucracy as treason against its mystery. Hence, <i>authority</i> is the basis of its knowledge, and the deification of authority is its <i>conviction</i>. Within the bureaucracy itself, however, <i>spiritualism</i> becomes <i>crass materialism</i>, the materialism of passive obedience, of faith in authority, of the <i>mechanism</i> of fixed and formalistic behaviour, and of fixed principles, views and traditions. In the case of the individual bureaucrat, the state objective turns into his private objective, into a <i>chasing after higher posts</i>, the <i>making of a career</i>. In the first place, he looks on actual life as something <i>material</i>, for the <i>spirit of this life has its distinctly separate existence</i> in the bureaucracy. The bureaucracy must therefore proceed to make life as material as possible. Secondly, actual life is material for the bureaucrat himself, i.e., so far as it becomes an object of bureaucratic manipulation; for his spirit is prescribed for him, his aim lies beyond him, and his existence is the existence of the department. The state only continues to exist as various fixed bureaucratic minds, bound together in subordination and passive obedience. <i>Actual</i> knowledge seems devotd of content, just as actual life seems dead; or this imaginary knowledge and this imaginary life are taken for the real thing.

So long as the state is Christian and the Jew is Jewish, the one is as incapable of granting emancipation as the other is of receiving it.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>The Christian state can behave towards the Jew only in the way characteristic of the Christian state, that is, by granting privileges, by permitting the separation of the Jew from the other subjects, but making him feel the pressure of all the other separate spheres of society, and feel it all the more intensely because he is in <i>religious</i> opposition to the dominant religion. But the Jew, too, can behave towards the state only in a Jewish way, that is, by treating it as something alien to him, by counterposing his imaginary nationality to the real nationality, by counterposing his illusory law to the real law, by deeming himself justified in separating himself from mankind, by abstaining on principle from taking part in the historical movement, by putting his trust in a future which has nothing in common with the future of mankind in general, and by seeing himself as a member of the Jewish people, and the Jewish people as the chosen people.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>On what grounds then do you Jews want emancipation? On account of your religion? It is the mortal enemy of the state religion. As citizens? In Germany there are no citizens. As human beings? But you are no more human beings than those to whom you appeal.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>Bauer has posed the question of Jewish emancipation in a new form, after giving a critical analysis of the previous formulations and solutions of the question. What, he asks, is the nature of the Jew who is to be emancipated and of the Christian state that is to emancipate him? He replies by a critique of the Jewish religion, he analyses the <i>religious</i> opposition between Judaism and Christianity, he elucidates the essence of the Christian state \u2014 and he does all this audaciously, trenchantly, wittily, and with profundity, in a style of writing that is as precise as it is pithy and vigorous.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p10\"></a>How then does Bauer solve the Jewish question? What is the result? The formulation of a question is its solution. The critique of the Jewish question is the answer to the Jewish question. The summary, therefore, is as follows:</p>", "<p><a id=\"p11\"></a>We must emancipate ourselves before we can emancipate others.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p12\"></a>The most rigid form of the opposition between the Jew and the Christian is the religious opposition. How is an opposition resolved? By making it impossible. How is <i>religious</i> opposition made impossible? By <i>abolishing religion</i>. As soon as Jew and Christian recognise that their respective religions are no more than <i>different stages in the development of the human mind</i>, different snake skins cast off by <i>history</i>, and that <i>man</i> is the snake who sloughed them, the relation of Jew and Christian is no longer religious but is only a critical, <i>scientific</i> and human relation. <i>Science</i> then constitutes their unity. But contradictions in science are resolved by science itself.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p13\"></a>The <i>German</i> Jew in particular is confronted by the general absence of political emancipation and the strongly marked Christian character of the state. In Bauer\u2019s conception, however, the Jewish question has a universal significance, independent of specifically German conditions. It is the question of the relation of religion to the state, of the <i>contradiction between religious constraint and political emancipation</i>. Emancipation from religion is laid down as a condition, both to the Jew who wants to be emancipated politically, and to the state which is to effect emancipation and is itself to be emancipated.</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p14\"></a>\u201cVery well,\u201d it is said, and the Jew himself says it, \u201cthe Jew is to become emancipated not as a Jew, not because he is a Jew, not because he possesses such an excellent, universally human principle of morality; on the contrary, the <i>Jew</i> will retreat behind the <i>citizen</i> and be a <i>citizen</i>, although he is a Jew and is to remain a Jew. That is to say, he is and remains a <i>Jew</i>, although he is a <i>citizen</i> and lives in universally human conditions: his Jewish and restricted nature triumphs always in the end over his human and political obligations. The <i>prejudice</i> remains in spite of being outstripped by <i>general</i> principles. But if it remains, then, on the contrary, it outstrips everything else.\u201d \u201cOnly sophistically, only apparently, would the Jew be able to remain a Jew in the life of the state. Hence, if he wanted to remain a Jew, the mere appearance would become the essential and would triumph; that is to say, his life in the state would be only a semblance or only a temporary exception to the essential and the rule.\u201d (\u201cDie F\u00e4higkeit der heutigen Juden und Christen, frei zu werden\u201d. <i>Einundzwanzig Bogen</i>, p. 57.)</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p15\"></a>Let us hear, on the other hand, how Bauer presents the task of the state.</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p16\"></a>\u201cFrance,\u201d he says, \u201chas recently shown us\u201d (Proceedings of the Chamber of Deputies, December 26, 1840) \u201cin connection with the Jewish question \u2014 just as it has continually done in all other <i>political</i> questions \u2014 the spectacle of a life which is free, but which revokes its freedom by law, hence declaring it to be an appearance, and on the other hand contradicting its free laws by its action.\u201d <i>(Die Judenfrage</i>, p. 64.)</blockquote>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p17\"></a>\u201cIn France, universal freedom is not yet the law, the <i>Jewish question too</i> has <i>not</i> yet been solved, because legal freedom \u2014 the fact that all citizens are equal \u2014 is restricted in actual life, which is still dominated and divided by religious privileges, and this lack of freedom in actual life reacts on law and compels the latter to sanction the division of the citizens, who as such are free, into oppressed and oppressors.\u201d (P. 65.)</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p18\"></a>When, therefore, would the Jewish question be solved for France?</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p19\"></a>\u201cThe Jew, for example, would have ceased to be a Jew if he did not allow himself to be prevented by his laws from fulfilling his duty to the state and his fellow citizens, that is, for example, if on the Sabbath he attended the Chamber of Deputies and took part in the official proceedings. Every <i>religious privilege</i>, and therefore also the monopoly of a privileged church, would have been abolished altogether, and if some or many persons, or <i>even the overwhelming majority</i>, <i>still believed themselves bound to fulfil religious duties</i>, this fulfilment ought to be left to <i>them</i> as a <i>purely private matter</i>.\u201d (P. 65.) \u201cThere is no longer any religion when there is no longer any privileged religion. Take from religion its exclusive power and it will no longer exist.\u201d (P. 66.) \u201cJust as M. Martin du Nord saw the proposal to omit mention of Sunday in the law as a motion to declare that Christianity has ceased to exist, with equal reason (and this reason is very well founded) the declaration that the law of the Sabbath is no longer binding on the Jew would be a proclamation abolishing Judaism.\u201d (P. 71.)</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p20\"></a>Bauer therefore demands, on the one hand, that the Jew should renounce Judaism, and that mankind in general should renounce religion, in order to achieve <i>civic</i> emancipation. On the other hand, he quite consistently regards the <i>political</i> abolition of religion as the abolition of religion as such. The state which presupposes religion is not yet a true, real state.</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p21\"></a>\u201cOf course, the religious notion affords security to the state. But to what state? <i>To what kind of state?\u201d</i> (P. 97.)</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p22\"></a>At this point the <i>one-sided</i> formulation of the Jewish question becomes evident.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p23\"></a>It was by no means sufficient to investigate: Who is to emancipate? Who is to be emancipated? Criticism had to investigate a third point. It had to inquire: <i>What kind of emancipation</i> is in question? What conditions follow from the very nature of the emancipation that is demanded? Only the criticism of <i>political emancipation</i> itself would have been the conclusive criticism of the Jewish question and its real merging in the <i>\u201cgeneral question of the time\u201d</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p24\"></a>Because Bauer does not raise the question to this level, he becomes entangled in contradictions. He puts forward conditions which are not based on the nature of <i>political</i> emancipation itself. He raises questions which are not part of his problem, and he solves problems which leave his question unanswered. When Bauer says of the opponents of Jewish emancipation: \u201cTheir error was only that they assumed the Christian state to be the only true one and did not subject it to the same criticism that they applied to Judaism\u201d (op. cit., p. 3), we find that his error lies in the fact that he subjects to criticism only the \u201cChristian state\u201d, not the \u201cstate as such\u201d, that he does not investigate <i>the relation of political emancipation to human emancipation</i> and therefore puts forward conditions which can be explained only by uncritical confusion of political emancipation with general human emancipation. If Bauer asks the Jews: Have you from your standpoint the right to want <i>political emancipation?</i> we ask the converse question: Does the standpoint of <i>political</i> emancipation give the right to demand from the Jew the abolition of Judaism and from man the abolition of religion?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p25\"></a>The Jewish question acquires a different form depending on the state in which the Jew lives. In Germany, where there is no political state, no state as such, the Jewish question is a purely <i>theological</i> one. The Jew finds himself in <i>religious</i> opposition to the state, which recognises Christianity as its basis. This state is a theologian <i>ex professo</i>. Criticism here is criticism of theology, a double-edged criticism, criticism of Christian theology and of Jewish theology. Hence, we continue to operate in the sphere of theology, however much we may operate <i>critically</i> within it.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p26\"></a>In France, a <i>constitutional</i> state, the Jewish question is a question of constitutionalism, the question of the <i>incompleteness of political emancipation</i>. Since the <i>semblance</i> of a state religion is retained here, although in a meaningless and self-contradictory formula, that of a <i>religion of the majority</i>, the relation of the Jew to the state retains the <i>semblance</i> of a religious, theological opposition.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p27\"></a>Only in the North American states \u2014 at least in some of them \u2014 does the Jewish question lose its <i>theological</i> significance and become a really <i>secular</i> question. Only where the political state exists in its completely developed form can the relation of the Jew, and of the religious man in general, to the political state, and therefore the relation of religion to the state, show itself in its specific character, in its purity. The criticism of this relation ceases to be theological criticism as soon as the state ceases to adopt a <i>theological</i> attitude towards religion, as soon as it behaves towards religion as a state, i.e., <i>politically</i>. Criticism then becomes <i>criticism of the political state</i>. At this point, where the question ceases to be <i>theological</i>, Bauer\u2019s criticism ceases to be critical.</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p28\"></a><i>\u201cIn the United States there is neither a state religion nor a religion declared to be that of the majority, nor the predominance of one cult over another. The state stands aloof from all cults.\u201d</i> <i>(Marie ou l\u2019esclavage aux Etats-Unis, etc</i>., par G. de Beaumont, [t. II,] Paris, 1835, p. 214.) Indeed, there are some North American states where \u201cthe constitution does not impose any religious belief or religious practice as a condition of political rights.\u201d (op. cit., p. 225.) Nevertheless, \u201cin the United States people do not believe that a man without religion could be an honest man.\u201d (op. cit., p. 224.)</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p29\"></a>Nevertheless, North America is pre-eminently the country of religiosity, as Beaumont, Tocqueville and the Englishman Hamilton unanimously assure us. [A. de Tocqueville, <i>De la D\u00e9mocratie en Am\u00e9rique;</i> Thomas Hamilton, <i>Men and Manners in North America</i>, Edinburgh, 1833, 2 vols. Marx quotes from the German translation <i>Die Menschen und die Sitten in den Vereinigten Staaten von Nordamerika</i>.] The North American states, however, serve us only as an example. The question is: What is the relation of <i>complete</i> political emancipation to religion? If we find that even in the country of complete political emancipation, religion not only <i>exists</i>, but displays a <i>fresh and vigorous vitality</i>, that is proof that the existence of religion is not in contradiction to the perfection of the state. Since, however, the existence of religion is the existence of a defect, the source of this defect can only be sought in the <i>nature</i> of the state itself. We no longer regard religion as the <i>cause</i>, but only as the <i>manifestation</i> of secular narrowness. Therefore we explain the religious limitations of the free citizens by their secular limitations. We do not assert that they must overcome their religious narrowness in order to get rid of their secular restrictions, we assert that they will overcome their religious narrowness once they get rid of their secular restrictions. We do not turn secular questions into theological questions. We turn theological questions into secular ones. History has long enough been merged in superstition, we now merge superstition in history. The question of the <i>relation of political emancipation to religion</i> becomes for us the question of the <i>relation of political emancipation to human emancipation</i>. We criticise the religious weakness of the political state by criticising the political state in its <i>secular</i> form, <i>apart</i> from its weaknesses as regards religion. The contradiction between the state and a <i>particular religion</i>, for instance <i>Judaism</i>, is given by us a human form as the contradiction between the state and <i>particular secular</i> elements; the contradiction between the state and <i>religion in general</i> as the contradiction between the state and its <i>presuppositions</i> in general.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p30\"></a>The political emancipation of the Jew, the Christian, and in general of <i>religious</i> man is the <i>emancipation of the state</i> from Judaism, from Christianity, from <i>religion</i> in general. In its own form, in the manner characteristic of its nature, the state as a <i>state</i> emancipates itself from religion by emancipating itself from the <i>state religion</i>, that is to say, by the state as a state not professing any religion, but, on the contrary, asserting itself as a state. The <i>political</i> emancipation from religion is not a religious emancipation that has been carried through to completion and is free from contradiction, because political emancipation is not a form of <i>human</i> emancipation which has been carried through to completion and is free from contradiction.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p31\"></a>The limits of political emancipation are evident at once from the fact that the <i>state</i> can free itself from a restriction without man being <i>really</i> free from this restriction, that the state can be a <i>free state</i> [A pun on the word <i>Freistaat</i>, i. e., republic, for if it is taken literally, it means \u201cfree state\u201d.] without man being a <i>free man</i>. Bauer himself tacitly admits this when he lays down the following condition for political emancipation:</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p32\"></a>\u201cEvery religious privilege, and therefore also the monopoly of a privileged church, would have been abolished altogether, and if some or many persons, or even the <i>overwhelming majority</i>, <i>still believed themselves bound to fulfil religious duties</i>, this fulfilment ought to be left to them as a <i>purely private matter.\u201d</i> [Bruno Bauer, <i>Die Judenfrage</i>, p. 65.]</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p33\"></a>It is possible, therefore, for the <i>state</i> to have emancipated itself from religion even if the <i>overwhelming majority</i> is still religious. And the overwhelming majority does not cease to be religious through being religious <i>in private</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p34\"></a>But the attitude of the state, and of the <i>republic</i> in particular, to religion is after all only the attitude to religion of the <i>men</i> who compose the state. It follows from this that man frees himself through the <i>medium of the state</i>, that he frees himself <i>politically</i> from a limitation when, in contradiction with himself, he raises himself above this limitation in an abstract, limited, and partial way. It follows further that, by freeing himself politically, man frees himself in a <i>roundabout way</i>, through an <i>intermediary</i>, although an <i>essential intermediary</i>. It follows, finally, that man, even if he proclaims himself an atheist through the medium of the state, that is, if he proclaims the state to be atheist, still remains in the grip of religion, precisely because he acknowledges himself only by a roundabout route, only through an intermediary. Religion is precisely the recognition of man in a roundabout way, through an <i>intermediary</i>. The state is the intermediary between man and man\u2019s freedom. Just as Christ is the intermediary to whom man transfers the burden of all his divinity, all his <i>religious constraint</i>, so the state is the intermediary to whom man transfers all his non-divinity and all his <i>human unconstraint</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p35\"></a>The <i>political</i> elevation of man above religion shares all the defects and all the advantages of political elevation in general. The state as a state annuls, for instance, <i>private property</i>, man declares by <i>political</i> means that private property is <i>abolished</i> as soon as the property qualification for the right to elect or be elected is abolished, as has occurred in many states of North America. <i>Hamilton</i> quite correctly interprets this fact from a political point of view as meaning: <i>\u201cthe masses have won a victory over the property owners and financial wealth\u201d</i>. [Thomas Hamilton, Die Menschen und die Sitten in den Vereinigten Staaten von Nordamerica, Bd. 1, S. 146.] Is not private property abolished in idea if the non-property owner has become the legislator for the property owner? The <i>property qualification</i> for the suffrage is the last <i>political</i> form of giving recognition to private property.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p36\"></a>Nevertheless the political annulment of private property not only fails to abolish private property but even presupposes it. The state abolishes, in its own way, distinctions of <i>birth</i>, <i>social rank</i>, <i>education</i>, <i>occupation</i>, when it declares that birth, social rank, education occupation, are <i>non-political</i> distinctions, when it proclaims, without regard to these distinctions, that every member of the nation is an <i>equal</i> participant in national sovereignty, when it treats all elements of the real life of the nation from the standpoint of the state. Nevertheless, the state allows private property, education, occupation, to <i>act</i> in <i>their</i> way, i.e., as private property, as education, as occupation, and to exert the influence of their <i>special</i> nature. Far from abolishing these <i>real</i> distinctions, the state only exists on the presupposition of their existence; it feels itself to be a <i>political state</i> and asserts its <i>universality</i> only in opposition to these elements of its being. <i>Hegel</i> therefore defines the relation of the <i>political state</i> to religion quite correctly when he says:</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p37\"></a>\u201cIn order [...] that the state should come into existence as the <i>self-knowing</i>, <i><b>moral reality</b></i> of the mind, its <i><b>distinction</b></i> from the form of authority and faith is essential. But this distinction emerges only insofar as the ecclesiastical aspect arrives at a <i><b>separation</b></i> within itself. It is <i><b>only</b></i> in this way that the state, <i><b>above</b></i> the <i>particular</i> churches, has achieved and brought into existence <i>universality</i> of thought, which is the principle of its form\u201d (Hegel\u2019s <i>Rechtsphilosophie</i>, 1st edition, p. 346). [Hegel, <i>Grundlinien der Philosophic des Rechts</i>. In this quotation words emphasised by Marx are set in bold italics, words emphasised by both Marx and Hegel in italics.]</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p38\"></a>Of course! Only in this way, <i>above</i> the <i>particular</i> elements, does the state constitute itself as universality.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p39\"></a>The perfect political state is, by its nature, man\u2019s <i>species-life</i>, as <i>opposed</i> to his material life. All the preconditions of this egoistic life continue to exist in <i>civil society outside</i> the sphere of the state, but as qualities of civil society. Where the political state has attained its true development, man \u2014 not only in thought, in consciousness, but in <i>reality</i>, in <i>life</i> \u2014 leads a twofold life, a heavenly and an earthly life: life in the <i>political community</i>, in which he considers himself a <i>communal being</i>, and life in <i>civil society</i>, in which he acts as a <i>private individual</i>, regards other men as a means, degrades himself into a means, and becomes the plaything of alien powers. The relation of the political state to civil society is just as spiritual as the relation of heaven to earth. The political state stands in the same opposition to civil society, and it prevails over the latter in the same way as religion prevails over the narrowness of the secular world, i.e., by likewise having always to acknowledge it, to restore it, and allow itself to be dominated by it. In his <i>most immediate</i> reality, in civil society, man is a secular being. Here, where he regards himself as a real individual, and is so regarded by others, he is a <i>fictitious</i> phenomenon. In the state, on the other hand, where man is regarded as a species-being, he is the imaginary member of an illusory sovereignty, is deprived of his real individual life and endowed with an unreal universality.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p40\"></a>Man, as the adherent of a <i>particular</i> religion, finds himself in conflict with his citizenship and with other men as members of the community. This conflict reduces itself to the <i>secular</i> division between the <i>political</i> state and <i>civil society</i>. For man as a <i>bourgeois</i>, [Here meaning a member of civil society.] \u201clife in the state\u201d is \u201conly a semblance or a temporary exception to the essential and the rule\u201d. [Bruno Bauer, \u201cDie Fahigkeit der heutigen Juden und Christen, frei zu werden\u201d, p. 57.] Of course, the <i>bourgeois</i>, like the Jew, remains only sophistically in the sphere of political life, just as the <i>citoyen</i> only sophistically remains a Jew or a <i>bourgeois</i>. But this sophistry is not personal. It is the sophistry of the political state itself. The difference between the religious man and the citizen is the difference between the merchant and the citizen, between the day-labourer and the citizen, between the landowner and the citizen, between the <i>living individual</i> and the <i>citizen</i>. The contradiction in which the religious man finds himself with the political man is the same contradiction in which the <i>bourgeois</i> finds himself with the <i>citoyen</i>, and the member of civil society with his <i>political lion\u2019s skin</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p41\"></a>This secular conflict, to which the Jewish question ultimately reduces itself, the relation between the political state and its preconditions, whether these are material elements, such as private property, etc., or spiritual elements, such as culture or religion, the conflict between the <i>general</i> interest and <i>private interest</i>, the schism between the <i>political state</i> and <i>civil society</i> \u2014 these secular antitheses Bauer allows to persist, whereas he conducts a polemic against their <i>religious</i> expression.</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p42\"></a>\u201cIt is precisely the basis of <i>civil society</i>, the need that ensures the continuance of this society and <i>guarantees its necessity</i>, which exposes its existence to continual dangers, maintains in it an element of uncertainty, and produces that continually changing mixture of poverty and riches, of distress and prosperity, and brings about change in general.\u201d (P. 8.)</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p43\"></a>Compare the whole section: \u201cCivil Society\u201d (pp. 8-9), which has been drawn up along the basic lines of Hegel\u2019s philosophy of law. Civil society, in its opposition to the political state, is recognised as necessary, because the political state is recognised as necessary.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p44\"></a><i>Political</i> emancipation is, of course, a big step forward. True, it is not the final form of human emancipation in general, but it is the final form of human emancipation <i>within</i> the hitherto existing world order. It goes without saying that we are speaking here of real, practical emancipation.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p45\"></a>Man emancipates himself <i>politically</i> from religion by banishing it from the sphere of public law to that of private law. Religion is no longer the spirit of the <i>state</i>, in which man behaves \u2014 although in a limited way, in a particular form, and in a particular sphere \u2014 as a species-being, in community with other men. Religion has become the spirit of <i>civil society</i>, of the sphere of egoism, of <i>bellum omnium contra omnes</i>. It is no longer the essence of <i>community</i>, but the essence of <i>difference</i>. It has become the expression of man\u2019s <i>separation</i> from his <i>community</i>, from himself and from other men \u2014 as it was <i>originally</i>. It is only the abstract avowal of specific perversity, <i>private whimsy</i>, and arbitrariness. The endless fragmentation of religion in North America, for example, gives it even externally the form of a purely individual affair. It has been thrust among the multitude of private interests and ejected from the community as such. But one should be under no illusion about the limits of political emancipation. The division of the human being into a <i>public man</i> and a <i>private man</i>, the <i>displacement</i> of religion from the state into civil society, this is not a stage of political emancipation but its <i>completion;</i> this emancipation therefore neither abolishes the <i>real</i> religiousness of man, nor strives to do so.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p46\"></a>The decomposition of man into Jew and citizen, Protestant and citizen, religious man and citizen, is neither a deception directed <i>against</i> citizenhood, nor is it a circumvention of political emancipation, it is <i>political emancipation itself</i>, the <i>political</i> method of emancipating oneself from religion. Of course, in periods when the political state as such is born violently out of civil society, when political liberation is the form in which men strive to achieve their liberation, the state can and must go as far as the <i>abolition of religion</i>, the <i>destruction</i> of religion. But it can do so only in the same way that it proceeds to the abolition of private property, to the maximum, to confiscation, to progressive taxation, just as it goes as far as the abolition of life, the <i>guillotine</i>. At times of special self-confidence, political life seeks to suppress its prerequisite, civil society and the elements composing this society, and to constitute itself as the real species-life of man devoid of contradictions. But it can achieve this only by coming into <i>violent</i> contradiction with its own conditions of life, only by declaring the revolution to be <i>permanent</i>, and therefore the political drama necessarily ends with the re-establishment of religion, private property, and all elements of civil society, just as war ends with peace.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p47\"></a>Indeed, the perfect Christian state is not the so-called <i>Christian</i> state, which acknowledges Christianity as its basis, as the state religion, and therefore adopts an exclusive attitude towards other religions. On the contrary, the perfect Christian state is the atheistic state, the <i>democratic</i> state, the state which relegates religion to a place among the other elements of civil society. The state which is still theological, which still officially professes Christianity as its creed, which still does not dare to proclaim itself <i>as a state</i>, has, in its reality as a state, not yet succeeded in expressing the <i>human</i> basis \u2014 of which Christianity is the high-flown expression \u2014 in a <i>secular</i>, <i>human</i> form. The so-called Christian state is simply nothing more than a <i>non-state</i>, since it is not Christianity as a religion, but only the <i>human background</i> of the Christian religion, which can find its expression in actual human creations.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p48\"></a>The so-called Christian state is the Christian negation of the state, but by no means the political realisation of Christianity. The state which still professes Christianity in the form of religion, does not yet profess it in the form appropriate to the state, for it still has a religious attitude towards religion, that is to say, it is not the <i>true implementation</i> of the human basis of religion, because it still relies on the <i>unreal</i>, <i>imaginary</i> form of this human core. The so-called Christian state is the <i>imperfect</i> state, and the Christian religion is regarded by it as the <i>supplementation</i> and <i>sanctification</i> of its imperfection. For the Christian state, therefore, religion necessarily becomes a <i>means;</i> hence it is a <i>hypocritical</i> state. It makes a great difference whether the <i>complete</i> state, because of the defect inherent in the general <i>nature</i> of the state, counts religion among its <i>presuppositions</i>, or whether the <i>incomplete</i> state, because of the defect inherent in its <i>particular existence</i> as a defective state, declares that religion is its <i>basis</i>. In the latter case, religion becomes imperfect politics. In the former case, the imperfection even of consummate <i>politics</i> becomes evident in religion. The so-called Christian state needs the Christian religion in order to complete itself <i>as a state</i>. The democratic state, the real state, does not need religion for its political completion. On the contrary, it can disregard religion because in it the human basis of religion is realised in a secular manner. The so-called Christian state, on the other hand, has a political attitude to religion and a religious attitude to politics. By degrading the forms of the state to mere semblance, it equally degrades religion to mere semblance.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p49\"></a>In order to make this contradiction clearer, let us consider Bauer\u2019s projection of the Christian state, a projection based on his observation of the Christian-German state.</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p50\"></a>\u201cRecently,\u201d says Bauer, \u201cin order to prove the <i>impossibility</i> or <i>non-existence</i> of a Christian state, reference has frequently been made to those sayings in the Gospel with which the [present-day] state <i>not only does not</i> comply, but <i>cannot possibly comply</i>, <i>if it does not want to dissolve itself completely</i> [as a state].\u201d \u201cBut the matter cannot be disposed of so easily. What do these Gospel sayings demand? Supernatural renunciation of self, submission to the authority of revelation, a turning-away from the state, the abolition of secular conditions. Well, the Christian state demands and accomplishes all that. It has assimilated the <i>spirit of the Gospel</i>, and if it does not reproduce this spirit in the same terms as the Gospel, that occurs only because it expresses this spirit in political forms, i.e., in forms which, it is true, are taken from the political system in this world, but which in the religious rebirth that they have to undergo become degraded to a mere semblance. This is a turning-away from the state while making use of political forms for its realisation.\u201d (P. 55.)</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p51\"></a>Bauer then explains that the people of a Christian state is only a non-people, no longer having a will of its own, but whose true existence lies in the leader to whom it is subjected, although this leader by his origin and nature is alien to it, i.e., given by God and imposed on the people without any co-operation on its part. Bauer declares that the laws of such a people are not its own creation, but are actual revelations, that its supreme chief needs privileged intermediaries with the people in the strict sense, with the masses, and that the masses themselves are divided into a multitude of particular groupings which are formed and determined by chance, which are differentiated by their interests, their particular passions and prejudices, and obtain permission, as a privilege, to isolate themselves from one another, etc. (P. 56.)</p>", "<p><a id=\"p52\"></a>However, Bauer himself says:</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p53\"></a>\u201cPolitics, if it is to be nothing but religion, ought not to be politics, just as the cleaning of saucepans, if it is to be accepted as a religious matter, ought not to be regarded as a matter of domestic economy.\u201d (P. 108.)</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p54\"></a>In the Christian-German state, however, religion is an \u201ceconomic matter\u201d just as \u201ceconomic matters\u201d belong to the sphere of religion. The domination of religion in the Christian-German state is the religion of domination.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p55\"></a>The separation of the \u201cspirit of the Gospel\u201d from the \u201cletter of the Gospel\u201d is an irreligious act. A state which makes the Gospel speak in the language of politics, that is, in another language than that of the Holy Ghost, commits sacrilege, if not in human eyes, then in the eyes of its own religion. The state which acknowledges Christianity as its supreme criterion and the <i>Bible</i> as its <i>Charter</i>, must be confronted with the <i>words</i> of Holy Scripture, for every word of Scripture is holy. This state, as well as the <i>human rubbish</i> on which it is based, is caught in a painful contradiction that is insoluble from the standpoint of religious consciousness when it is referred to those sayings of the Gospel with which it \u201cnot only does not comply, but <i>cannot possibly comply</i>, <i>if it does not want to dissolve itself completely as a state\u201d</i>. And why does it not want to dissolve itself completely? The state itself cannot give an answer either to itself or to others. In its <i>own consciousness</i> the official Christian state is an <i>imperative</i>, the realisation of which is unattainable, the state can assert the <i>reality</i> of its existence only by lying to itself, and therefore always remains in its own eyes an object of doubt, an unreliable, problematic object. Criticism is therefore fully justified in forcing the state that relies on the Bible into a mental derangement in which it no longer knows whether it is an <i>illusion</i> or a <i>reality</i>, and in which the infamy of its <i>secular</i> aims, for which religion serves as a cloak, comes into insoluble conflict with the sincerity of its <i>religious</i> consciousness, for which religion appears as the aim of the world. This state can only save itself from its inner torment if it becomes the <i>police agent</i> of the Catholic Church. In relation to the church, which declares the secular power to be its servant, the state is powerless, the <i>secular</i> power which claims to be the rule of the religious spirit is powerless.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p56\"></a>It is indeed <i>estrangement</i> which matters in the so-called Christian state, but not <i>man</i>. The only man who counts, the <i>king</i>, is a being specifically different from other men, and is moreover a religious being, directly linked with heaven, with God. The relationships which prevail here are still relationships dependent on <i>faith</i>. The religious spirit, therefore, is still not really secularised.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p57\"></a>But, furthermore, the religious spirit cannot be <i>really</i> secularised, for what is it in itself but the <i>non-secular</i> form of a stage in the development of the human mind? The religious spirit can only be secularised insofar as the stage of development of the human mind of which it is the religious expression makes its appearance and becomes constituted in its <i>secular</i> form. This takes place in the <i>democratic</i> state. Not Christianity, but the <i>human basis</i> of Christianity is the basis of this state. Religion remains the ideal, non-secular consciousness of its members, because religion is the ideal form of the <i>stage of human development</i> achieved in this state.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p58\"></a>The members of the political state are religious owing to the dualism between individual life and species-life, between the life of civil society and political life. They are religious because men treat the political life of the state, an area beyond their real individuality, as if it were their true life. They are religious insofar as religion here is the spirit of civil society, expressing the separation and remoteness of man from man. Political democracy is Christian since in it man, not merely one man but every man, ranks as sovereign, as the highest being, but it is man in his uncivilised, unsocial form, man in his fortuitous existence, man just as he is, man as he has been corrupted by the whole organisation of our society, who has lost himself, been alienated, and handed over to the rule of inhuman conditions and elements \u2014 in short, man who is not yet a <i>real</i> species-being. That which is a creation of fantasy, a dream, a postulate of Christianity, i.e., the sovereignty of man \u2014 but man as an alien being different from the real man \u2014 becomes in democracy tangible reality, present existence, and secular principle.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p59\"></a>In the perfect democracy, the religious and theological consciousness itself is in its own eyes the more religious and the more theological because it is apparently without political significance, without worldly aims, the concern of a disposition that shuns the world, the expression of intellectual narrow-mindedness, the product of arbitrariness and fantasy, and because it is a life that is really of the other world. Christianity attains here the <i>practical</i> expression of its universal-religious significance in that the most diverse world outlooks are grouped alongside one another in the form of Christianity and still more because it does not require other people to profess Christianity, but only religion in general, any kind of religion (cf. Beaumont\u2019s work quoted above). The religious consciousness revels in the wealth of religious contradictions and religious diversity.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p60\"></a>We have thus shown that political emancipation from religion leaves religion in existence, although not a privileged religion. The contradiction in which the adherent of a particular religion finds himself involved in relation to his citizenship is only <i>one aspect</i> of the universal <i>secular contradiction between the political state and civil society</i>. The consummation of the Christian state is the state which acknowledges itself as a state and disregards the religion of its members. The emancipation of the state from religion is not the emancipation of the real man from religion.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p61\"></a>Therefore we do not say to the Jews as Bauer does: You cannot be emancipated politically without emancipating yourselves radically from Judaism. On the contrary, we tell them: Because you can be emancipated politically without renouncing Judaism completely and incontrovertibly, <i>political emancipation</i> itself is not <i>human</i> emancipation. If you Jews want to be emancipated politically without emancipating yourselves humanly, the half-hearted approach and contradiction is not in you alone, it is inherent in the <i>nature</i> and <i>category</i> of political emancipation. If you find yourself within the confines of this category, you share in a general confinement. Just as the state <i>evangelises</i> when, although it is a state, it adopts a Christian attitude towards the Jews, so the Jew <i>acts politically</i> when, although a Jew, he demands civic rights.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p62\"></a>But if a man, although a Jew, can be emancipated politically and receive civic rights, can he lay claim to the so-called <i>rights of man</i> and receive them? Bauer <i>denies</i> it.</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p63\"></a>\u201cThe question is whether the Jew as such, that is, the Jew who himself admits that he is compelled by his true nature to live permanently in separation from other men, is capable of receiving the <i>universal rights of man</i> and of conceding them to others.\u201d</blockquote>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p64\"></a>\u201cFor the Christian world, the idea of the rights of man was only discovered in the last century. It is not innate in men; on the contrary, it is gained only in a struggle against the historical traditions in which hitherto man was brought up. Thus the rights of man are not a gift of nature, not a legacy from past history, but the reward of the struggle against the accident of birth and against the privileges which up to now have been handed down by history from generation to generation. These rights are the result of culture, and only one who has earned and deserved them can possess them.\u201d</blockquote>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p65\"></a>\u201cCan the Jew really take possession of them? As long as he is a Jew, the restricted nature which makes him a Jew is bound to triumph over the human nature which should link him as a man with other men, and will separate him from non-Jews. He declares by this separation that the particular nature which makes him a Jew is his true, highest nature, before which human nature has to give way.\u201d</blockquote>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p66\"></a>\u201cSimilarly, the Christian as a Christian cannot grant the rights of man.\u201d (P. 19, 20.)</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p67\"></a>According to Bauer, man has to sacrifice the <i>\u201cprivilege of faith\u201d</i> to be able to receive the universal rights of man. Let us examine for a moment the so-called rights of man, to be precise, the rights of man in their authentic form, in the form which they have among those who <i>discovered</i> them, the North Americans and the French. These rights of man are in part <i>political</i> rights, rights which can only be exercised in a community with others. Their content is <i>participation</i> in the <i>community</i>, and specifically in the <i>political</i> community, in the <i>life of the state</i>. They come within the category of <i>political freedom</i>, the category of <i>civic rights</i>, which, as we have seen, in no way presuppose the incontrovertible and positive abolition of religion, nor therefore of Judaism. There remains to be examined the other part of the rights of man, the <i>droits de l\u2019homme</i> [rights of man] insofar as these differ from the <i>droits du citoyen</i>. [rights of the citizen]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p68\"></a>Included among them is freedom of conscience, the right to practise any religion one chooses.

The <i>privilege of faith</i> is a <i>universal right of man</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p74\"></a>The <i>droits de l\u2019homme</i>, the rights of man, are as <i>such</i> distinct from the <i>droits du citoyen</i>, the rights of the citizen.

Let us hear what the most radical Constitution, the Constitution of 1793, has to say:</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p76\"></a><i>Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.

The limits within which anyone can act <i>without harming</i> someone else are defined by law, just as the boundary between two fields is determined by a boundary post. It is a question of the liberty of man as an isolated monad, withdrawn into himself. Why is the Jew, according to Bauer, incapable of acquiring the rights of man?</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p80\"></a>\u201cAs long as he is a Jew, the restricted nature which makes him a Jew is bound to triumph over the human nature which should link him as a man with other men, and will separate him from non-Jews.\u201d</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p81\"></a>But the right of man to liberty is based not on the association of man with man, but on the separation of man from man. It is the right of this separation, the right of the <i>restricted</i> individual, withdrawn into himself.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p82\"></a>The practical application of man\u2019s right to liberty is man\u2019s right to <i>private property</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p83\"></a>What constitutes man\u2019s right to private property?</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p84\"></a><i>Article 16</i> (Constitution of 1793): \u201cThe right of <i>property</i> is that which every citizen has of enjoying and of disposing <i>at his discretion</i> of his goods and income, of the fruits of his labour and industry.\u201d</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p85\"></a>The right of man to private property is, therefore, the right to enjoy one\u2019s property and to dispose of it at one\u2019s discretion <i>(\u00e0 son gr\u00e9)</i>, without regard to other men, independently of society, the right of self-interest. This individual liberty and its application form the basis of civil society. It makes every man see in other men not the realisation of his own freedom, but the barrier to it. But, above all, it proclaims the right of man</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p86\"></a>\u201cof enjoying and of disposing <i>at his discretion</i> of his goods and income, of the fruits of his labour and industry\u201d.</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p87\"></a>There remain the other rights of man: <i>\u00e9galit\u00e9</i> and <i>s\u00fbret\u00e9</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p88\"></a><i>\u00c9galit\u00e9</i>, used here in its non-political sense, is nothing but the equality of the <i>libert\u00e9</i> described above, namely: each man is to the same extent regarded as such a self-sufficient monad. The Constitution of 1795 defines the concept of this equality, in accordance with its significance, as follows:</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p89\"></a><i>Article 3</i> (Constitution of 1795): \u201cEquality consists in the law being the same for all, whether it protects or punishes.\u201d</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p90\"></a>And <i>s\u00fbret\u00e9?</i></p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p91\"></a><i>Article 8</i> (Constitution of 1793): \u201cSecurity consists in the protection afforded by society to each of its members for the preservation of his person, his rights, and his property.\u201d</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p92\"></a><i>Security</i> is the highest social concept of civil society, the concept of <i>police</i>, expressing the fact that the whole of society exists only in order to guarantee to each of its members the preservation of his person, his rights, and his property. It is in this sense that Hegel calls civil society \u201cthe state of need and reason\u201d. [Hegel, <i>Grundlinien der Philosophic des Rechts</i>. <i>Werke</i>. Bd. VIII, S. 242.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p93\"></a>The concept of security does not raise civil society above its egoism. On the contrary, security is the <i>insurance</i> of its egoism.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p94\"></a>None of the so-called rights of man, therefore, go beyond egoistic man, beyond man as a member of civil society, that is, an individual withdrawn into himself, into the confines of his private interests and private caprice, and separated from the community. In the rights of man, he is far from being conceived as a species-being; on the contrary, species-life itself, society, appears as a framework external to the individuals, as a restriction of their original independence. The sole bond holding them together is natural necessity, need and private interest, the preservation of their property and their egoistic selves.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p95\"></a>It is puzzling enough that a people which is just beginning to liberate itself, to tear down all the barriers between its various sections, and to establish a political community, that such a people solemnly proclaims (Declaration of 1791) the rights of egoistic man separated from his fellow men and from the community, and that indeed it repeats this proclamation at a moment when only the most heroic devotion can save the nation, and is therefore imperatively called for, at a moment when the sacrifice of all the interests of civil society must be the order of the day, and egoism must be punished as a crime. (Declaration of the Rights of Man, etc., of 1793.) This fact becomes still more puzzling when we see that the political emancipators go so far as to reduce citizenship, and the <i>political community</i>, to a mere <i>means</i> for maintaining these so-called rights of man, that therefore the <i>citoyen</i> is declared to be the servant of egoistic <i>homme</i>, that the sphere in which man acts as a communal being is degraded to a level below the sphere in which he acts as a partial being, and that, finally, it is not man as <i>citoyen</i>, but man as <i>bourgeois</i> who is considered to be the <i>essential</i> and <i>true</i> man.</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p96\"></a>\u201cThe aim of all <i>political association</i> is the <i>preservation</i> of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man.\u201d (Declaration of the Rights, etc., of 1791, Article 2.) <i>\u201cGovernment</i> is instituted in order to guarantee man the enjoyment of his natural and imprescriptible rights.\u201d (Declaration, etc., of 1793, Article 1.)</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p97\"></a>Hence even in moments when its enthusiasm still has the freshness of youth and is intensified to an extreme degree by the force of circumstances, political life declares itself to be a mere <i>means</i>, whose purpose is the life of civil society. It is true that its revolutionary practice is in flagrant contradiction with its theory. Whereas, for example, security is declared one of the rights of man, violation of the privacy of correspondence is openly declared to be the order of the day. Whereas the \u201cunlimited freedom of the press\u201d (Constitution of 1793, Article 122) is guaranteed as a consequence of the right of man to individual liberty, freedom of the press is totally destroyed, because \u201cfreedom of the press should not be permitted when it endangers public liberty\u201d. (Robespierre jeune, <i>Histoire parlementaire de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise</i> par Buchez et Roux, T. 28, p. 159.) That is to say, therefore: The right of man to liberty ceases to be a right as soon as it comes into conflict with <i>political</i> life, whereas in theory political life is only the guarantee of human rights, the rights of the individual, and therefore must be abandoned as soon as it comes into contradiction with its <i>aim</i>, with these rights of man. But practice is merely the exception, theory is the rule. But even if one were to regard revolutionary practice as the correct presentation of the relationship, there would still remain the puzzle of why the relationship is turned upside-down in the minds of the political emancipators and the aim appears as the means, while the means appears as the aim. This optical illusion of their consciousness would still remain a puzzle, although now a psychological, a theoretical puzzle.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p98\"></a>The puzzle is easily solved.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p99\"></a>Political emancipation is at the same time the <i>dissolution</i> of the old society on which the state alienated from the people, the sovereign power, is based. Political revolution is a revolution of civil society. What was the character of the old society? It can be described in one word \u2014 <i>feudalism</i>. The character of the old civil society was <i>directly political</i>, that is to say, the elements of civil life, for example, property, or the family, or the mode of labour, were raised to the level of elements of political life in the form of seigniory, estates, and corporations. In this form they determined the relation of the individual to the <i>state as a whole</i>, i.e., his <i>political</i> relation, that is, his relation of separation and exclusion from the other components of society. For that organisation of national life did not raise property or labour to the level of social elements; on the contrary, it completed their <i>separation</i> from the state as a whole and constituted them as <i>discrete</i> societies within society. Thus, the vital functions and conditions of life of civil society remained nevertheless political, although political in the feudal sense, that is to say, they secluded the individual from the state as a whole and they converted the <i>particular</i> relation of his corporation to the state as a whole into his general relation to the life of the nation, just as they converted his particular civil activity and situation into his general activity and situation. As a result of this organisation, the unity of the state, and also the consciousness, will and activity of this unity, the general power of the state, are likewise bound to appear as the <i>particular</i> affair of a ruler isolated from the people, and of his servants.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p100\"></a>The political revolution which overthrew this sovereign power and raised state affairs to become affairs of the people, which constituted the political state as a matter of <i>general</i> concern, that is, as a real state, necessarily smashed all estates, corporations, guilds, and privileges, since they were all manifestations of the separation of the people from the community. The political revolution thereby <i>abolished</i> the <i>political character of civil society</i>. It broke up civil society into its simple component parts; on the one hand, the <i>individuals;</i> on the other hanci, the <i>material</i> and <i>spiritual elements</i> constituting the content of the life and social position of these individuals. It set free the political spirit, which had been, as it were, split up, partitioned and dispersed in the various blind alleys of feudal society. It gathered the dispersed parts of the political spirit, freed it from its intermixture with civil life, and established it as the sphere of the community, the <i>general</i> concern of the nation, ideally independent of those <i>particular</i> elements of civil life. A person\u2019s <i>distinct</i> activity and distinct situation in life were reduced to a merely individual significance. They no longer constituted the general relation of the individual to the state as a whole. Public affairs as such, on the other hand, became the general affair of each individual, and the political function became the individual\u2019s general function.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p101\"></a>But the completion of the idealism of the state was at the same time the completion of the materialism of civil society. Throwing off the political yoke meant at the same time throwing off the bonds which restrained the egoistic spirit of civil society. Political emancipation was at the same time the emancipation of civil society from politics, from having even the <i>semblance</i> of a universal content.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p102\"></a>Feudal society was resolved into its basic element \u2014 <i>man</i>, but man as he really formed its basis \u2014 <i>egoistic</i> man.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p103\"></a>This <i>man</i>, the member of civil society, is thus the basis, the precondition, of the <i>political</i> state. He is recognised as such by this state in the rights of man.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p104\"></a>The liberty of egoistic man and the recognition of this liberty, however, is rather the recognition of the <i>unrestrained</i> movement of the spiritual and material elements which form the content of his life.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p105\"></a>Hence man was not freed from religion, he received religious freedom. He was not freed from property, he received freedom to own property. He was not freed from the egoism of business, he received freedom to engage in business.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p106\"></a>The <i>establishment of the political state</i> and the dissolution of civil society into independent <i>individuals</i> \u2014 whose relations with one another depend on <i>law</i>, just as the relations of men in the system of estates and guilds depended on <i>privilege</i> \u2014 is accomplished by <i>one and the same act</i>. Man as a member of civil society, <i>unpolitical</i> man, inevitably appears, however, as the <i>natural</i> man. The <i>droits de l\u2019homme</i> appear as <i>droits naturels</i>, because <i>conscious activity</i> is concentrated on the <i>political act</i>. <i>Egoistic</i> man is the <i>passive</i> result of the dissolved society, a result that is simply <i>found in existence</i>, an object of <i>immediate certainty</i>, therefore a <i>natural</i> object. The <i>political revolution</i> resolves civil life into its component parts, without <i>revolutionising</i> these components themselves or subjecting them to criticism. It regards civil society, the world of needs, labour, private interests, civil law, as the <i>basis of its existence</i>, as a <i>precondition</i> not requiring further substantiation and therefore as its <i>natural basis</i>. Finally, man as a member of civil society is held to be man <i>in the proper sense</i>, <i>homme</i> as distinct from the <i>citoyen</i>, because he is man in his sensuous, individual, <i>immediate</i> existence, whereas <i>political</i> man is only abstract, artificial man, man as an <i>allegorical</i>, <i>juridical</i> person.

The theological problem as to whether the Jew or the Christian has the better prospect of salvation is repeated here in the enlightened form: which of them is <i>more capable of emancipation</i>.

On the contrary, the question is now: Which makes man freer, the negation of Judaism or the negation of Christianity?</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p5\"></a>\u201cIf the Jews want to become free, they should profess belief not in Christianity, but in the dissolution of Christianity, in the dissolution of religion in general, that is to say, in enlightenment, criticism and its consequence, free humanity.\u201d (P. 70.)</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>For the Jew, it is still a matter of a <i>profession of faith</i>, but no longer a profession of belief in Christianity, but of belief in Christianity in dissolution.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>Bauer demands of the Jews that they should break with the essence of the Christian religion, a demand which, as he says himself, does not arise out of the development of Judaism.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>Since Bauer, at the end of his work on the Jewish question, had conceived Judaism only as crude religious criticism of Christianity, and therefore saw in it \u201cmerely\u201d a religious significance, it could be foreseen that the emancipation of the Jews, too, would be transformed into a philosophical-theological act.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>Bauer considers that the <i>ideal</i>, abstract nature of the Jew, his religion, is his entire nature.

The emancipation of the Jew is in itself not a task for the Christian.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p12\"></a>The Jew, on the other hand, in order to emancipate himself, has to carry out not only his own work, but also that of the Christian, i.e., the <i>Kritik der Synoptiker</i> and <i>Das Leben Jesu</i>, [A reference to Bruno Bauer, <i>Kritik der evangelischen Geschichte der Synoptiker</i>, and David Friedrich Strauss, <i>Das Leben Jesu</i>.] etc.</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p13\"></a>\u201cIt is up to them to deal with it: they themselves will decide their fate; but history is not to be trifled with.\u201d (P. 71.)</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p14\"></a>We are trying to break with the theological formulation of the question. For us, the question of the Jew\u2019s capacity for emancipation becomes the question: What particular <i>social</i> element has to be overcome in order to abolish Judaism? For the present-day Jew\u2019s capacity for emancipation is the relation of Judaism to the emancipation of the modern world.

His religious consciousness would be dissipated like a thin haze in the real, vital air of society. On the other hand, if the Jew recognises that this <i>practical</i> nature of his is futile and works to abolish it, he extricates himself from his previous development and works for <i>human emancipation</i> as such and turns against the <i>supreme practical</i> expression of human self-estrangement.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p21\"></a>We recognise in Judaism, therefore, a general <i>anti-social</i> element of the <i>present time</i>, an element which through historical development \u2014 to which in this harmful respect the Jews have zealously contributed \u2014 has been brought to its present high level, at which it must necessarily begin to disintegrate.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p22\"></a>In the final analysis, the <i>emancipation of the Jews</i> is the emancipation of mankind from <i>Judaism</i>.

In his view the world is no more than a Stock Exchange, and he is convinced that he has no other destiny here below than to become richer than his neighbour.

Man is <i>the world of man</i>, the state, society. This state, this society, produce religion, an <i>inverted world-consciousness</i>, because they are an <i>inverted world</i>. Religion is the general theory of that world, its encyclopaedic compendium, its logic in a popular form, its spiritualistic <i>point d\u2019honneur</i>, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement, its universal source of consolation and justification.

The actual pressure must be made more pressing by adding to it consciousness of pressure, the shame must be made more shameful by publicising it.

The struggle against the German political present is the struggle against the past of the modern nations, and they are still troubled by reminders of that past. It is instructive for them to see the <i>ancien r\u00e9gime</i>, which has been through its <i>tragedy</i> with them, playing its <i>comedy</i> as a German ghost. <i>Tragic</i> indeed was the history of the <i>ancien r\u00e9gime</i> so long as it was the pre-existing power of the world, and freedom, on the other hand, was a personal notion, i.e., as long as this regime believed and had to believe in its own justification. As long as the <i>ancien r\u00e9gime</i>, as an existing world order, struggled against a world that was only coming into being, there was on its side a historical error, not a personal one.

If it believed in its own <i>essence</i>, would it try to hide that essence under the <i>semblance</i> of an alien essence and seek refuge in hypocrisy and sophism? The modern <i>ancien r\u00e9gime</i> is only the <i>comedian</i> of a world order whose true heroes are dead. History is thorough and goes through many phases when carrying an old form to the grave. The last phase of a world-historical form is its <i>comedy</i>. The gods of Greece, already tragically wounded to death in Aeschylus\u2019 <i>Prometheus Bound</i>, had to re-die a comic death in Lucian\u2019s <i>Dialogues</i>. Why this course of history? So that humanity should part with its past <i>cheerfully</i>. This <i>cheerful</i> historical destiny is what we vindicate for the political authorities of Germany.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p18\"></a>However, once <i>modern</i> politico-social reality itself is subjected to criticism, once criticism rises to truly human problems, it finds itself outside the German <i>status quo</i> or else it would reach out for its object <i>below</i> its object. An example. The relation of industry, of the world of wealth generally, to the political world is one of the major problems of modern times. In what form is this problem beginning to engage the attention of the Germans? In the form of <i>protective duties</i>, of the <i>prohibitive system</i>, of <i>national economy</i>. Germanomania has passed out of man into matter, and thus one morning our cotton barons and iron champions saw themselves turned into patriots. People are therefore beginning in Germany to acknowledge the sovereignty of monopoly within the country by lending it <i>sovereignty abroad</i>. People are thus about to begin in Germany with what people in France and England are about to end. The old corrupt condition against which these countries are rebelling in theory and which they only bear as one bears chains is greeted in Germany as the dawn of a beautiful future which still hardly dares to pass from <i>cunning</i> [In the German <i>listig</i>, probably an allusion to Friedrich List, who was an advocate of protectionism.] theory to the most ruthless practice. Whereas the problem in France and England is: <i>Political economy</i> or the <i>rule of society over wealth</i>, in Germany it is: <i>National economy</i> or the <i>mastery of private property over nationality</i>. In France and England, then, it is a case of abolishing monopoly that has proceeded to its last consequences; in Germany it is a case of proceeding to the last consequences of monopoly. There it is a case of solution, here as yet a case of collision. This is an adequate example of the <i>German</i> form of modern problems, an example of how our history, like a clumsy recruit, still has to do extra drill in matters that are old and hackneyed in history.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p19\"></a>If therefore the <i>whole</i> German development did not exceed the German <i>political</i> development, a German could at the most participate in the problems of the present to the same extent as a <i>Russian</i> can. But, if the separate individual is not bound by the limitations of the nation, still less is the nation as a whole liberated by the liberation of one individual. The fact that Greece had a Scythian [Anacharsis.] among its philosophers did not help the Scythians to make a single step towards Greek culture.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p20\"></a>Luckily we Germans are not Scythians.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p21\"></a>As the ancient peoples went through their pre-history in imagination, in <i>mythology</i>, so we Germans have gone through our post-history in thought, in <i>philosophy</i>. We are <i>philosophical</i> contemporaries of the present without being its <i>historical</i> contemporaries. German philosophy is the <i>ideal prolongation</i> of German history. If therefore, instead of the <i>\u0153uvres incompl\u00e8tes</i> of our real history, we criticise the <i>\u0153uvres posthumes</i> of our ideal history, <i>philosophy</i>, our criticism is among the questions of which the present says: <i>That is the question</i>. What in advanced nations is a <i>practical</i> break with modern political conditions, is in Germany, where even those conditions do not yet exist, at first a <i>critical</i> break with the philosophical reflection of those conditions.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p22\"></a><i>German philosophy of law and state</i> is the only <i>German history</i> which is <i>al pari</i> with the <i>official</i> modern reality. The German nation must therefore take into account not only its present conditions but also its dream-history, and subject to criticism not only these existing conditions but at the same time their abstract continuation. Its future cannot be <i>limited</i> either to the immediate negation of its real conditions of state and law or to the immediate implementation of its ideal state and legal conditions, for it has the immediate negation of its real conditions in its ideal conditions, and it has almost <i>outlived</i> the immediate implementation of its ideal conditions in the contemplation of neighbouring nations. Hence it is with good reason that the <i>practical</i> political party in Germany [This refers to the liberal circles of Germany, representatives of the liberal opposition in the Landtags, liberal publicists of various descriptions, and others, who demanded constitutional reforms.] demands the <i>negation of philosophy</i>. It is wrong, not in its demand, but in stopping at the demand, which it neither seriously implements nor can implement. It believes that it implements that negation by turning its back on philosophy and with averted face muttering a few trite and angry phrases about it. Owing to the limitation of its outlook it does not include philosophy in the circle of <i>German</i> reality or it even fancies it is <i>beneath</i> German practice and the theories that serve it. You demand that <i>real living germs</i> be made the starting point but you forget that the real living germ of the German nation has grown so far only inside its <i>cranium</i>. In a word \u2014 <i>you cannot supersede philosophy without making it a reality</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p23\"></a>The same mistake, but with the factors <i>reversed</i>, was made by the <i>theoretical</i> political party originating from philosophy. [This refers to the Young Hegelians. They drew radical atheistic conclusions from Hegel\u2019s philosophy but at the same time detached philosophy from reality and turned it into a self-contained and determining force. In fact the Young Hegelians were withdrawing more and more from the practical revolutionary struggle.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p24\"></a>In the present struggle it saw <i>only the critical struggle of philosophy against the German world;</i> it did not give a thought to the fact that the <i>hitherto prevailing philosophy</i> itself belongs to this world and is its <i>complement</i>, although an ideal one. Critical towards its adversary, it was uncritical towards itself when, proceeding from the <i>premises</i> of philosophy, it either stopped at the results given by philosophy or passed off demands and results from somewhere else as immediate demands and results of philosophy, although these, provided they are justified, can be obtained only by the <i>negation of hitherto existing philosophy</i>, of philosophy as such. We reserve ourselves the right to a more detailed description of this party. Its basic deficiency may be reduced to the following: <i>It thought it could make philosophy a reality without superseding it</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p25\"></a>The criticism of the <i>German philosophy of state and law</i>, which attained its most consistent, richest and final formulation through <i>Hegel</i>, is both a critical analysis of the modern state and of the reality connected with it, and the resolute negation of the whole <i>German political and legal consciousness</i> as <i>practised</i> hitherto, the most distinguished, most universal expression of which, raised to the level of a science, is the speculative philosophy of law itself. If the speculative philosophy of law, that abstract extravagant <i>thinking</i> on the modern state, the reality of which remains a thing of the beyond, if only beyond the Rhine, was possible only in Germany, inversely the <i>German</i> thought-image of the modern state which disregards <i>real man</i> was possible only because and insofar as the modern state itself disregards <i>real man</i> or satisfies the <i>whole</i> of man only in imagination. In politics the Germans <i>thought</i> what other nations <i>did</i>. Germany was their <i>theoretical consciousness</i>. The abstraction and conceit of its thought always kept in step with the one-sidedness and stumpiness of its reality. If therefore the <i>status quo of German statehood</i> expresses the <i>perfection of the ancien r\u00e9gime</i>, the perfection of the thorn in the flesh of the modern state, the <i>status quo of German political theory</i> expresses the <i>imperfection of the modern state</i>, the defectiveness of its flesh itself.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p26\"></a>Even as the resolute opponent of the previous form of <i>German</i> political consciousness the criticism of speculative philosophy of law turns, not towards itself, but towards <i>problems</i> which can only be solved by one means \u2014 <i>practice</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p27\"></a>It is asked: can Germany attain a practice <i>\u00e0 la hauteur des principes</i>, i. e., a <i>revolution</i> which will raise it not only to the <i>official level</i> of the modern nations but to the <i>height of humanity</i> which will be the near future of those nations?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p28\"></a>The weapon of criticism cannot, of course, replace criticism by weapons, material force must be overthrown by material force; but theory also becomes a material force as soon as it has gripped the masses. Theory is capable of gripping the masses as soon as it demonstrates <i>ad hominem</i>, and it demonstrates <i>ad hominem</i> as soon as it becomes radical. To be radical is to grasp the root of the matter. But for man the root is man himself. The evident proof of the radicalism of German theory, and hence of its practical energy, is that it proceeds from a resolute positive abolition of religion. The criticism of religion ends with the teaching that <i>man is the highest being for man</i>, hence with the <i>categorical imperative to overthrow all relations</i> in which man is a debased, enslaved, forsaken, despicable being, relations which cannot be better described than by the exclamation of a Frenchman when it was planned to introduce a tax on dogs: Poor dogs! They want to treat you like human beings!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p29\"></a>Even historically, theoretical emancipation has specific practical significance for Germany. For Germany\u2019s <i>revolutionary</i> past is theoretical, it is the <i>Reformation</i>. As the revolution then began in the brain of the <i>monk</i>, so now it begins in the brain of the <i>philosopher</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p30\"></a><i>Luther</i>, we grant, overcame the bondage of <i>piety</i> by replacing it by the bondage of <i>conviction</i>. He shattered faith in authority because he restored the authority of faith. He turned priests into laymen because he turned laymen into priests. He freed man from outer religiosity because he made religiosity the inner man. He freed the body from chains because he enchained the heart.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p31\"></a>But if Protestantism was not the true solution it was at least the true setting of the problem. It was no longer a case of the layman\u2019s struggle against the <i>priest outside himself</i> but of his struggle against his <i>own priest inside himself</i>, his <i>priestly nature</i>. And if the Protestant transformation of the German laymen into priests emancipated the lay popes, the <i>princes</i>, with the whole of their priestly clique, the privileged and philistines, the philosophical transformation of priestly Germans into men will emancipate the <i>people</i>. But <i>secularisation</i> will not stop at the <i>pillaging of churches</i> practised mainly by hypocritical Prussia any more than emancipation stops at princes. The Peasant War, the most radical fact of German history, came to grief because of theology. Today, when theology itself has come to grief, the most unfree fact of German history, our <i>status quo</i>, will be shattered against philosophy. On the eve of the Reformation official Germany was the most unconditional slave of Rome. On the eve of its revolution it is the unconditional slave of less than Rome, of Prussia and Austria, of country squires and philistines.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p32\"></a>A major difficulty, however, seems to stand in the way of a <i>radical</i> German revolution.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p33\"></a>For revolutions require a <i>passive</i> element, a <i>material</i> basis. Theory can be realised in a people only insofar as it is the realisation of the needs of that people. But will the enormous discrepancy between the demands of German thought and the answers of German reality be matched by a corresponding discrepancy between civil society and the state and between civil society and itself? Will the theoretical needs be immediate practical needs? It is not enough for thought to strive for realisation, reality must itself strive towards thought.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p34\"></a>But Germany did not go through the intermediary stages of political emancipation at the same time as the modern nations. It has not even reached in practice the stages which it has overtaken in theory. How can it do a <i>somersault</i>, not only over its own limitations, but at the same time over the limitations of the modern nations, over limitations which in reality it must feel and strive for as bringing emancipation from its real limitations? Only a revolution of radical needs can be a radical revolution and it seems that for this the preconditions and ground are lacking.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p35\"></a>If however Germany has accompanied the development of the modern nations only with the abstract activity of thought without playing an effective role in the real struggle of that development, it has, on the other hand, shared the <i>sufferings</i> of that development, without sharing in its enjoyment or its partial satisfaction. To abstract activity on the one hand corresponds abstract suffering on the other. That is why Germany will one day find itself on the level of European decadence before ever having been on the level of European emancipation. It will be comparable to a <i>fetish worshipper</i> pining away with the diseases of Christianity.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p36\"></a>If we now consider the <i>German governments</i> we find that because of the existing state of affairs, because of Germany\u2019s condition, because of the standpoint of German education and finally under the impulse of their own fortunate instinct, they are driven to combine the <i>civilised shortcomings of the modern political world</i>, the advantages of which we do not enjoy, with the <i>barbaric deficiencies of the ancien r\u00e9gime</i>, which we enjoy in full; hence Germany must share more and more, if not in the reasonableness, at least in the unreasonableness of those state formations which are beyond the bounds of its <i>status quo</i>. Is there in the world, for example, a country which shares so naively in all the illusions of the constitutional state without sharing in its realities as so-called constitutional Germany? And was it not perforce a German government\u2019s idea to combine the tortures of censorship with the tortures of the French September laws which presuppose freedom of the press? [The <i>September laws</i> promulgated by the French Government in September 1835 restricted the rights of the jury and introduced severe measures against the press. They provided for increased money deposits for periodical publications and introduced imprisonment and large fines for publishing statements against private property and the existing state system. The enactment of these laws in conditions of the July constitutional monarchy, which formally proclaimed freedom of the press, emphasised the anti-democratic nature and hypocrisy of the bourgeois system.] As you could find the <i>gods</i> of all nations in the Roman Pantheon, so you will find in the Germans\u2019 Holy Roman Empire all the <i>sins</i> of all political forms. [The <i>Holy Roman Empire of the German nation</i> (962-1806) comprised at different times German, Italian, Austrian, Hungarian and Czech lands, Switzerland and the Netherlands and was a loose confederation of feudal kingdoms and principalities, church domains and free cities with different political systems, laws and traditions.] That this eclecticism will reach a height never dreamt of before is guaranteed in particular by the <i>political-aesthetic gourmandising</i> of a German king [Frederick William IV.] who intends to play all the roles of monarchy, whether feudal or bureaucratic, absolute or constitutional, autocratic or democratic, if not in the person of the people, at least in his <i>own</i> person, and if not for the people, at least for <i>himself</i>. <i>Germany</i>, <i>as the deficiency of the political present constituted as a particular world</i>, will not be able to throw down the specific German limitations without throwing down the general limitation of the political present.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p37\"></a>It is not the <i>radical</i> revolution, not the <i>general human</i> emancipation which is a utopian dream for Germany, but rather the partial, the <i>merely</i> political revolution, the revolution which leaves the pillars of the house standing. On what is a partial, a merely political revolution based? On the fact that <i>part of civil society</i> emancipates itself and attains <i>general</i> domination; on the fact that a definite class, proceeding from its <i>particular situation</i>, undertakes the general emancipation of society. This class emancipates the whole of society but only provided the whole of society is in the same situation as this class, e.g., possesses money and education or can acquire them at will.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p38\"></a>No class of civil society can play this role without arousing a moment of enthusiasm in itself and in the masses, a moment in which it fraternises and merges with society in general, becomes confused with it and is perceived and acknowledged as its <i>general representative;</i> a moment in which its demands and rights are truly the rights and demands of society itself; a moment in which it is truly the social head and the social heart. Only in the name of the general rights of society can a particular class lay claim to general domination. For the storming of this emancipatory position, and hence for the political exploitation of all spheres of society in the interests of its own sphere, revolutionary energy and intellectual self-confidence alone are not sufficient. For the <i>revolution of a nation</i> and the <i>emancipation of a particular class</i> of civil society to coincide, for <i>one</i> estate to be acknowledged as the estate of the whole society, all the defects of society must conversely be concentrated in another class, a particular estate must be the general stumbling-block, the incorporation of the general limitation, a particular social sphere must be looked upon as the <i>notorious crime</i> of the whole of society, so that liberation from that sphere appears as general self-liberation. For <i>one</i> estate to be <i>par excellence</i> the estate of liberation, another estate must conversely be the obvious estate of oppression. The negative general significance of the French nobility and the French clergy determined the positive general significance of the immediately adjacent and opposed class of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p39\"></a>But no particular class in Germany has the consistency, the severity, the courage or the ruthlessness that could mark it out as the negative representative of society. No more has any estate the breadth of soul that identifies itself, even for a moment, with the soul of the nation, the genius that inspires material might to political violence, or that revolutionary audacity which flings at the adversary the defiant words: <i>I am nothing and I should be everything</i>. The main stem of German morals and honesty, of the classes as well as of individuals, is rather that <i>modest egoism</i> which asserts its limitedness and allows it to be asserted against itself. The relation of the various sections of German society is therefore not dramatic but epic. Each of them begins to be aware of itself and to settle down beside the others with all its particular claims not as soon as it is oppressed, but as soon as the circumstances of the time, without the section\u2019s own participation, create a social substratum on which it can in turn exert pressure. Even the <i>moral self-confidence of the German middle class</i> rests only on the consciousness that it is the general representative of the philistine mediocrity of all the other classes. It is therefore not only the German kings who accede to the throne <i>mal \u00e0 propos;</i> every section of civil society goes through a defeat before it has celebrated victory, develops its own limitations before it has overcome the limitations facing it and asserts its narrow-hearted essence before it has been able to assert its magnanimous essence. Thus the very opportunity of a great role has on every occasion passed away before it is to hand, thus every class, once it begins the struggle against the class above it, is involved in the struggle against the class below it. Hence the princes are struggling against the monarchy, the bureaucrats against the nobility, and the bourgeois against them all, while the proletariat is already beginning to struggle against the bourgeoisie. No sooner does the middle class dare to think of emancipation from its own standpoint than the development of the social conditions and the progress of political theory pronounce that standpoint antiquated or at least problematic.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p40\"></a>In France it is enough for somebody to be something for him to want to be everything; in Germany one has to be nothing if one is not to forego everything. In France partial emancipation is the basis of universal emancipation; in Germany universal emancipation is the <i>conditio sine qua non</i> of any partial emancipation. In France it is the reality of gradual liberation, in Germany the impossibility of gradual liberation, that must give birth to complete freedom. In France every class is <i>politically idealistic</i> and becomes aware of itself at first not as a particular class but as the representative of social requirements generally. The role of <i>emancipator</i> therefore passes in dramatic motion to the various classes of the French nation one after the other until it finally comes to the class which implements social freedom no longer on the basis of certain conditions lying outside man and yet created by human society, but rather organises all conditions of human existence on the presupposition of social freedom. In Germany, on the contrary, where practical life is as spiritless as spiritual life is unpractical, no class in civil society has any need or capacity for general emancipation until it is forced by its <i>immediate</i> condition, by <i>material</i> necessity, by its <i>very chains</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p41\"></a>Where, then, is the <i>positive</i> possibility of a German emancipation?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p42\"></a><i>Answer:</i> In the formation of a class with <i>radical chains</i>, a class of civil society which is not a class of civil society, an estate which is the dissolution of all estates, a sphere which has a universal character by its universal suffering and claims no particular right because no <i>particular wrong</i> but <i>wrong generally</i> is perpetrated against it; which can no longer invoke a <i>historical</i> but only a <i>human</i> title; which does not stand in any one-sided antithesis to the consequences but in an all-round antithesis to the premises of the German state; a sphere, finally, which cannot emancipate itself without emancipating itself from all other spheres of society and thereby emancipating all other spheres of society, which, in a word, is the <i>complete loss</i> of man and hence can win itself only through the <i>complete rewinning of man</i>. This dissolution of society as a particular estate is the <i>proletariat</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p43\"></a>The proletariat is coming into being in Germany only as a result of the rising <i>industrial</i> development. For it is not the <i>naturally arising</i> poor but the <i>artificially impoverished</i>, not the human masses mechanically oppressed by the gravity of society but the masses resulting from the <i>drastic dissolution</i> of society, mainly of the middle estate, that form the proletariat, although it is obvious that gradually the naturally arising poor and the Christian-Germanic serfs also join its ranks.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p44\"></a>By proclaiming the <i>dissolution of the hitherto existing world order</i> the proletariat merely states the <i>secret of its own existence</i>, for it <i>is in fact</i> the dissolution of that world order. By demanding the <i>negation of private property</i>, the proletariat merely raises to the rank of a <i>principle of society</i> what society has made the principle of the <i>proletariat</i>, what, without its own co-operation, is already incorporated in it as the negative result of society. In regard to the world which is coming into being the proletarian then finds himself possessing the same right as the <i>German king</i> in regard to the world which has come into being when he calls the people <i>his</i> people as he calls the horse <i>his</i> horse. By declaring the people his private property the king simply states that the property owner is king.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p45\"></a>As philosophy finds its <i>material</i> weapons in the proletariat, so the proletariat finds its <i>spiritual</i> weapons in philosophy. And once the lightning of thought has squarely struck this ingenuous soil of the people the emancipation of the <i>Germans</i> into <i>human beings</i> will take place.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p46\"></a>Let us sum up the result:</p>", "<p><a id=\"p47\"></a>The only <i>practically</i> possible liberation of Germany is liberation that proceeds from the standpoint of <i>the</i> theory which proclaims man to be the highest being for man. In Germany emancipation from the <i>Middle Ages</i> is possible only as emancipation from the <i>partial</i> victories over the Middle Ages as well. In Germany <i>no</i> kind of bondage can be broken without breaking <i>every</i> kind of bondage. The <i>thorough</i> Germany cannot make a revolution without making a <i>thoroughgoing</i> revolution. The <i>emancipation of the German</i> is the <i>emancipation of the human being</i>. The <i>head</i> of this emancipation is <i>philosophy</i>, its <i>heart</i> is the <i>proletariat</i>. Philosophy cannot be made a reality without the abolition of the proletariat, the proletariat cannot be abolished without philosophy being made a reality.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p48\"></a>When all inner requisites are fulfilled the <i>day of German resurrection</i> will be proclaimed by the <i>ringing call of the Gallic cock</i>.</p>"], "year": "1844", "sourceBook": "Contribution to the Critique of Hegel\u2019s Philosophy of Law.

Introduction", "idChr": "1.07text"}, {"content": ["<p><a id=\"p0\"></a>Credit is conceivable in two relationships and under two different conditions. The two relationships are: first, a rich man gives credit to a poor man whom he considers industrious and decent. This kind of credit belongs to the romantic, sentimental part of political economy, to its aberrations, excesses, <i>exceptions</i>, not to the <i>rule</i>. But even assuming this exception and granting this romantic possibility, the life of the poor man and his talents and activity serve the rich man as a <i>guarantee</i> of the repayment of the money lent. That means, therefore, that all the social virtues of the poor man, the content of his vital activity, his existence itself, represent for the rich man the reimbursement of his capital with the customary interest. Hence the death of the poor man is the worst eventuality for the creditor. It is the death of his capital together with the interest. One ought to consider how vile it is to <i>estimate</i> the value of a man in <i>money</i>, as happens in the credit relationship. As a matter of course, the creditor possesses, besides moral guarantees, also the guarantee of legal compulsion and still other more or less real guarantees for his man. If the man to whom credit is given is himself a man of means, <i>credit</i> becomes merely a <i>medium</i> facilitating exchange, that is to say, <i>money</i> itself is raised to a completely <i>ideal</i> form. <i>Credit</i> is the <i>economic</i> judgment on the <i>morality</i> of a man. In credit, the man himself, instead of metal or paper, has become the <i>mediator</i> of exchange, not however as a man, but as the <i>mode of existence of capital</i> and interest. The medium of exchange, therefore, has certainly returned out of its material form and been put back in man, but only because the man himself has been put outside himself and has himself assumed a material form. Within the credit relationship, it is not the case that money is transcended in man, but that man himself is turned into <i>money</i>, or money is <i>incorporated</i> in him. <i>Human individuality</i>, human <i>morality</i> itself, has become both an object of commerce and the <i>material</i> in which money exists. Instead of money, or paper, it is my own personal existence, my flesh and blood, my social virtue and importance, which constitutes the material, corporeal form of the <i>spirit of money</i>. Credit no longer resolves the value of money into money but into human flesh and the human heart. Such is the extent to which all progress and all inconsistencies within a false system are extreme retrogression and the extreme consequence of vileness.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p1\"></a>Within the credit system, its nature, estranged from man, under the appearance of an extreme economic appreciation of man, operates in a double way:</p>", "<p><a id=\"p2\"></a>1) The antithesis between capitalist and worker, between big and small capitalists, becomes still greater since credit is given only to him who already has, and is a new opportunity of accumulation for the rich man, or since the poor man finds that the arbitrary discretion of the rich man and the latter\u2019s judgment over him confirm or deny his entire existence and that his existence is wholly dependent on this contingency.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>2) Mutual dissimulation, hypocrisy and sanctimoniousness are carried to extreme lengths, so that on the man without credit is pronounced not only the simple judgment that he is poor, but in addition a pejorative moral judgment that he possesses no trust, no recognition, and therefore is a social pariah, a bad man, and in addition to his privation, the poor man undergoes this humiliation and the humiliating necessity of having to ask the rich man for credit.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>3) Since, owing to this completely <i>nominal</i> existence of money, <i>counterfeiting</i> cannot be undertaken by man in any other material than his own person, he has to make himself into counterfeit coin, obtain credit by stealth, by lying, etc., and this credit relationship \u2014 both on the part of the man who trusts and of the man who needs trust \u2014 becomes an object of commerce, an object of mutual deception and misuse. Here it is also glaringly evident that <i>distrust</i> is the basis of economic trust; distrustful calculation whether credit ought to be given or not; spying into the secrets of the private life, etc., of the one seeking credit; the disclosure of temporary straits in order to overthrow a rival by a sudden shattering of his credit, etc. The whole system of bankruptcy, spurious enterprises, etc.... As regards <i>government loans</i>, the state occupies exactly the same place as the man does in the earlier example.... In the game with government securities it is seen how the state has become the plaything of businessmen, etc.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>4) The <i>credit system</i> finally has its completion in the <i>banking system</i>. The creation of bankers, the political domination of the bank, the concentration of wealth in these hands, this economic <i>Areopagus</i> of the nation, is the worthy completion of the money system.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>Owing to the fact that in the credit system the <i>moral recognition of a man</i>, as also <i>trust in the state</i>, etc., take the form of <i>credit</i>, the secret contained in the lie of moral recognition, the <i>immoral</i> vileness of this morality, as also the sanctimoniousness and egoism of that trust in the state, become evident and show themselves for what they really are.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a><i>Exchange</i>, both of human activity within production itself and of <i>human products</i> against one another, is equivalent to <i>species-activity</i> and species-spirit, the real, conscious and true mode of existence of which is social activity and social enjoyment. Since <i>human</i> nature is the <i>true community</i> of men, by manifesting their <i>nature</i> men <i>create</i>, produce, the <i>human community</i>, the social entity, which is no abstract universal power opposed to the single individual, but is the essential nature of each individual, his own activity, his own life, his own spirit, his own wealth. Hence this <i>true community</i> does not come into being through reflection, it appears owing to the <i>need</i> and <i>egoism</i> of individuals, i.e., it is produced directly by their life activity itself. It does not depend on man whether this community exists or not; but as long as man does not recognise himself as man, and therefore has not organised the world in a human way, this community appears in the form of <i>estrangement</i>, because its <i>subject</i>, man, is a being estranged from himself. Men, not as an abstraction, but as real, living, particular individuals, <i>are</i> this entity. Hence, <i>as</i> they are, so is this entity itself. To say that <i>man</i> is estranged from himself, therefore, is the same thing as saying that the <i>society</i> of this estranged man is a caricature of his <i>real community</i>, of his true species-life, that his activity therefore appears to him as a torment, his own creation as an alien power, his wealth as poverty, the <i>essential bond</i> linking him with other men as an unessential bond, and separation from his fellow men, on the other hand, as his true mode of existence, his life as a sacrifice of his life, the realisation of his nature as making his life unreal, his production as the production of his nullity, his power over an object as the power of the object over him, and he himself, the lord of his creation, as the servant of this creation.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>The <i>community of men</i>, or the manifestation of the nature of <i>men</i>, their mutual complementing the result of which is species-life, truly human life \u2014 this community is conceived by political economy in the form of <i>exchange</i> and <i>trade</i>. <i>Society</i>, says Destutt de Tracy, is a <i>series of mutual exchanges</i>.

Each of its members is a <i>merchant</i>. [See Adam Smith, \u201cWealth of Nations\u201d, Book I, Ch. IV.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>It is seen that political economy <i>defines</i> the <i>estranged</i> form of social intercourse as the <i>essential</i> and <i>original</i> form corresponding to man\u2019s nature.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p10\"></a>Political economy \u2014 like the real process \u2014 starts out from the <i>relation of man to man</i> as that of <i>property owner to property owner</i>. If man is presupposed as <i>property owner</i>, i.e., therefore as an exclusive owner, who proves his personality and both distinguishes himself from, and enters into relations with, other men through this exclusive ownership \u2014 private property is his personal, distinctive, and therefore essential mode of existence \u2014 then the <i>loss</i> or <i>surrender</i> of private property is an <i>alienation of man</i>, as it is of <i>private property</i> itself. Here we shall only be concerned with the latter definition. If I give up my private property to someone else, it ceases to be <i>mine;</i> it becomes something independent of me, lying outside my sphere, a thing external to me. Hence I <i>alienate</i> my private property. With regard to me, therefore, I turn it into <i>alienated</i> private property. But I only turn it into an <i>alienated</i> thing in general, I abolish only my <i>personal</i> relation to it, I give it back to the <i>elementary</i> powers of nature if I alienate it only with regard to myself. It becomes alienated <i>private property</i> only if, while ceasing to be <i>my</i> private property, it on that account does not cease to be <i>private property</i> as such, that is to say, if it enters into the same relation to <i>another</i> man, <i>apart</i> from me, as that which it had to myself; in short, if it becomes the <i>private property</i> of <i>another</i> man. The case of <i>violence</i> excepted \u2014 what causes me to alienate <i>my</i> private property to another man? Political economy replies correctly: <i>necessity</i>, <i>need</i>. The other man is also a property owner, but he is the owner of <i>another</i> thing, which I lack and cannot and will not do without, which seems to me a <i>necessity</i> for the completion of my existence and the realisation of my nature.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p11\"></a>The bond which connects the two property owners with each other is the <i>specific kind of object</i> that constitutes the substance of their private property. The desire for these two objects, i.e., the need for them, shows each of the property owners, and makes him conscious of it, that he has yet another <i>essential</i> relation to objects besides that of private ownership, that he is not the particular being that he considers himself to be, but a <i>total</i> being whose needs stand in the relationship of <i>inner</i> ownership to all products, including those of another\u2019s labour. For the need of a thing is the most evident, irrefutable proof that the thing belongs to <i>my</i> essence, that its being is for me, that its <i>property</i> is the property, the peculiarity, of my essence. Thus both property owners are impelled to give up their private property, but to do so in such a way that at the same time they confirm private ownership, or to give up the private property within the relationship of private ownership. Each therefore alienates a part of his private property to the other.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p12\"></a>The <i>social</i> connection or <i>social</i> relationship between the two property owners is therefore that of <i>reciprocity</i> in <i>alienation</i>, positing the relationship of alienation on both sides, or <i>alienation</i> as the relationship of both property owners, whereas in simple private property, <i>alienation</i> occurs only in relation to oneself, one-sidedly.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p13\"></a><i>Exchange</i> or <i>barter</i> is therefore the social act, the species-act, the community, the social intercourse and integration of men within <i>private ownership</i>, and therefore the external, <i>alienated</i> species-act. It is just for this reason that it appears as <i>barter</i>. For this reason, likewise, it is the opposite of the <i>social</i> relationship.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p14\"></a>Through the reciprocal alienation or estrangement of private property, <i>private property</i> itself falls into the category of <i>alienated</i> private property. For, in the first place, it has ceased to be the product of the labour of its owner, his exclusive, distinctive personality. For he has alienated it, it has moved away from the owner whose product it was and has acquired a personal significance for someone whose product it is not. It has lost its personal significance for the owner. Secondly, it has been brought into relation with another private property, and placed on a par with the latter. Its place has been taken by a private property of a <i>different</i> kind, just as it itself takes the place of a private property of a <i>different</i> kind. On both sides, therefore, private property appears as the representative of a different kind of private property, as the <i>equivalent</i> of a <i>different</i> natural product, and both sides are related to each other in such a way that each represents the mode of existence of the <i>other</i>, and both relate to each other as <i>substitutes</i> for themselves and the other. Hence the mode of existence of private property as such has become that of a <i>substitute</i>, of an <i>equivalent</i>. Instead of its immediate unity with itself, it exists now only as a relation to <i>something else</i>. Its mode of existence as an <i>equivalent</i> is no longer its specific mode of existence. It has thus become a <i>value</i>, and immediately an <i>exchange-value</i>. Its mode of existence as <i>value</i> is an <i>alienated</i> designation <i>of itself</i>, different from its immediate existence, external to its specific nature, a merely <i>relative</i> mode of existence of this.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p15\"></a>How this <i>value</i> is more precisely determined must be described elsewhere, as also how it becomes <i>price</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p16\"></a>The relationship of exchange being presupposed, <i>labour</i> becomes <i>directly labour to earn a living</i>. This relationship of alienated labour reaches its highest point only when 1) on one side <i>labour to earn a living</i> and the product of the worker have no <i>direct</i> relation to his need or his <i>function as worker</i>, but both aspects are determined by social combinations alien to the worker; 2) he who <i>buys</i> the product is not himself a producer, but gives in exchange what someone else has produced. In the crude form of <i>alienated</i> private property, <i>barter</i>, each of the property owners has produced what his immediate need, his talents and the available raw material have impelled him to make. Each, therefore, exchanges with the other only the surplus of his production. It is true that labour was his immediate <i>source of subsistence</i>, but it was at the same time also the manifestation of his <i>individual existence</i>. Through exchange his labour has become partly a <i>source of income</i>. Its purpose differs now from its mode of existence. The product is produced as <i>value</i>, as <i>exchange-value</i>, as an <i>equivalent</i>, and no longer because of its direct, personal relation to the producer. The more diverse production becomes, and therefore the more diverse the needs become, on the one hand, and the more one-sided the activities of the producer become, on the other hand, the more does his labour fall into the category of <i>labour to earn a living</i>, until finally it has only this significance and it becomes quite <i>accidental</i> and <i>inessential</i> whether the relation of the producer to his product is that of immediate enjoyment and personal need, and also whether his <i>activity</i>, the act of labour itself, is for him the enjoyment of his personality and the realisation of his natural abilities and spiritual aims.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p17\"></a><i>Labour to earn a living</i> involves: 1) estrangement and fortuitous connection between labour and the subject who labours; 2) estrangement and fortuitous connection between labour and the object of labour; 3) that the worker\u2019s role is determined by social needs which, however, are alien to him and a compulsion to which he submits out of egoistic need and necessity, and which have for him only the significance of a means of satisfying his dire need, just as for them he exists only as a slave of their needs; 4) that to the worker the maintenance of his individual existence appears to be the <i>purpose</i> of his activity and what he actually does is regarded by him only as a means; that he carries on his life\u2019s activity in order to earn means of <i>subsistence</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p18\"></a>Hence the greater and the more developed the social power appears to be within the private property relationship, the more <i>egoistic</i>, asocial and estranged from his own nature does man become.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p19\"></a>Just as the mutual exchange of the products of <i>human activity</i> appears as <i>barter</i>, as trade, so the mutual completion and exchange of the activity itself appears as <i>division of labour</i>, which turns man as far as possible into an abstract being, a machine tool, etc., and transforms him into a spiritual and physical monster.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p20\"></a>It is precisely the unity of human labour that is regarded merely as <i>division</i> of labour, because social nature only comes into existence as its opposite, in the form of estrangement. <i>Division of labour</i> increases with civilisation.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p21\"></a>Within the presupposition of division of labour, the product, the material of private property, acquires for the individual more and more the significance of an <i>equivalent</i>, and as he no longer exchanges only his <i>surplus</i>, and the object of his production can be simply a <i>matter of indifference</i> to him, so too he no longer exchanges his product for something directly <i>needed</i> by him. The equivalent comes into existence as an equivalent in <i>money</i>, which is now the immediate result of labour to gain a living and the <i>medium</i> of exchange (see above).</p>", "<p><a id=\"p22\"></a>The complete domination of the estranged thing <i>over</i> man has become evident in <i>money</i>, which is completely indifferent both to the nature of the material, i.e., to the specific nature of the private property, and to the personality of the property owner. What was the domination of person over person is now the general domination of the <i>thing</i> over the <i>person</i>, of the product over the producer. Just as the concept of the <i>equivalent</i>, the value, already implied the <i>alienation</i> of private property, so <i>money</i> is the sensuous, even objective existence of this <i>alienation</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p23\"></a>Needless to say that political economy is only able to grasp this whole development as a fact, as the outcome of fortuitous necessity.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p24\"></a>The separation of work from itself \u2014 separation of the worker from the capitalist \u2014 separation of labour and capital, the original form of which is made up of <i>landed property</i> and <i>movable property</i>.... The original determining feature of private property is monopoly; hence when it creates a political constitution, it is that of monopoly. The perfect monopoly is competition.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p25\"></a>To the economist, <i>production</i>, <i>consumption</i> and, as the mediator of both, <i>exchange</i> or <i>distribution</i>, are separate [activities]. [This refers primarily to James Mill, who divided his system of political economy into four independent sections: Production, Distribution, Exchange and Consumption.] The separation of production and consumption, of action and spirit, in different individuals and in the same individual, is the <i>separation of labour</i> from its <i>object</i> and from itself as something spiritual. <i>Distribution</i> is the power of private property manifesting itself.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p26\"></a>The separation of labour, capital and landed property from one another, like that of labour from labour, of capital from capital, and landed property from landed property, and finally the separation of labour from wages, of capital from profit, and profit from interest, and, last of all, of landed property from land rent, demonstrate self-estrangement both in the form of self-estrangement and in that of mutual estrangement.</p>", "<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p27\"></a>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"stea\"><b>***</b></span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>", "<p><a id=\"p28\"></a>Man <i>produces</i> only in order to <i>have</i> \u2014 this is the basic presupposition of private property. The aim of production is <i>having</i>. And not only does production have this kind of <i>useful</i> aim; it has also a <i>selfish</i> aim; man produces only in order to <i>possess</i> for himself; the object he produces is the objectification of his <i>immediate</i>, selfish <i>need</i>. For man himself \u2014 in a savage, barbaric condition \u2014 therefore, the amount of his production is determined by the <i>extent</i> of his immediate need, the content of which is <i>directly</i> the object produced.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p29\"></a>Under these conditions, therefore, man produces <i>no more</i> than he immediately requires. The <i>limit of his need</i> forms the <i>limit of his production</i>. Thus demand and supply exactly coincide. The extent of his production is <i>measured</i> by his need. In this case no exchange takes place, or exchange is reduced to the exchange of his labour for the product of his labour, and this exchange is the latent form, the germ, of real exchange.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p30\"></a>As soon as exchange takes place, a surplus is produced beyond the immediate limit of possession. But this surplus production does not mean rising above selfish need. On the contrary, it is only an <i>indirect</i> way of satisfying a need which finds its objectification not in <i>this</i> production but in the production of someone else. Production has become a <i>means of gaining a living</i>, labour to gain a living. Whereas under the first state of affairs, therefore, need is the measure of production, under the second state of affairs production, or rather <i>ownership of the product</i>, is the measure of how far needs can be satisfied.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p31\"></a>I have produced for myself and not for you, just as you have produced for yourself and not for me. In itself, the result of my production has as little connection with you as the result of your production has directly with me. That is to say, our production is not man\u2019s production for man as a man, i.e., it is not <i>social</i> production. Neither of us, therefore, as a man stands in a relation of enjoyment to the other\u2019s product. As men, we do not exist as far as our respective products are concerned. Hence our exchange, too, cannot be the mediating process by which it is confirmed that my product is [for] you, because it is an <i>objectification</i> of your own nature, your need. For it is not <i>man\u2019s nature</i> that forms the link between the products we make for one another. Exchange can only set in <i>motion</i>, only confirm, the <i>character</i> of the relation which each of us has in regard to his own product, and therefore to the product of the other. Each of us sees in his product only the objectification of his <i>own</i> selfish need, and therefore in the product of the other the objectification of a <i>different</i> selfish need, independent of him and alien to him.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p32\"></a>As a man you have, of course, a human relation to my product: you have <i>need</i> of my product. Hence it exists for you as an object of your desire and your will. But your need, your desire, your will, are powerless as regards my product. That means, therefore, that your <i>human</i> nature, which accordingly is bound to stand in intimate relation to my human production, is not your power over this production, your possession of it, for it is not the <i>specific character</i>, not the <i>power</i>, of man\u2019s nature that is recognised in my production. They [your need, your desire, etc.] constitute rather the <i>tie</i> which makes you dependent on me, because they put you in a position of dependence on my product. Far from being the <i>means</i> which would give you <i>power</i> over my production, they are instead the <i>means</i> for giving me power over you.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p33\"></a>When I produce <i>more</i> of an object than I myself can directly use, my <i>surplus</i> production is cunningly <i>calculated</i> for your need. It is only in <i>appearance</i> that I produce a surplus of this object. In reality I produce a <i>different</i> object, the object of your production, which I intend to exchange against this surplus, an exchange which in my mind I have already completed. The <i>social</i> relation in which I stand to you, my labour for your need, is therefore also a mere <i>semblance</i>, and our complementing each other is likewise a mere <i>semblance</i>, the basis of which is mutual plundering. The intention of <i>plundering</i>, of <i>deception</i>, is necessarily present in the background, for since our exchange is a selfish one, on your side as on mine, and since the selfishness of each seeks to get the better of that of the other, we necessarily seek to deceive each other. It is true though, that the power which I attribute to my object over yours requires your <i>recognition</i> in order to become a real power. Our mutual recognition of the respective powers of our objects, however, is a struggle, and in a struggle the victor is the one who has more energy, force, insight, or adroitness. If I have sufficient physical force, I plunder you directly. If physical force cannot be used, we try to impose on each other by bluff, and the more adroit overreaches the other. For the <i>totality</i> of the relationship, it is a matter of chance who overreaches whom. The <i>ideal</i>, <i>intended</i> overreaching takes place on both sides, i.e., each in his own judgment has overreached the other.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p34\"></a>On both sides, therefore, exchange is necessarily mediated by the <i>object</i> which each side produces and possesses. The ideal relationship to the respective objects of our production is, of course, our mutual need. But the <i>real</i>, <i>true</i> relationship, which <i>actually</i> occurs and takes effect, is only the mutually <i>exclusive possession</i> of our respective products. What gives your need of my article its <i>value</i>, <i>worth</i> and <i>effect</i> for me is solely your <i>object</i>, the <i>equivalent</i> of my object. Our respective products, therefore, are the <i>means</i>, the <i>mediator</i>, the <i>instrument</i>, the <i>acknowledged power</i> of our mutual needs. Your <i>demand</i> and the <i>equivalent of your possession</i>, therefore, are for me terms that are <i>equal in significance</i> and validity, and your demand only acquires a <i>meaning</i>, owing to having an effect, when it has meaning and effect in relation to me. As a mere human being without this instrument your demand is an unsatisfied aspiration on your part and an idea that does not exist for me. As a human being, therefore, you stand in no relationship to my object, because <i>I myself</i> have no human relationship to it. But the <i>means</i> is the <i>true power</i> over an object and therefore we mutually regard our products as the <i>power</i> of each of us over the other and over himself. That is to say, our own product has risen up against us; it seemed to be our property, but in fact we are its property. We ourselves are excluded from <i>true</i> property because our <i>property</i> excludes other men.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p35\"></a>The only intelligible language in which we converse with one another consists of our objects in their relation to each other. We would not understand a human language and it would remain without effect. By one side it would be recognised and felt as being a request, an entreaty, and therefore a <i>humiliation</i>, and consequently uttered with a feeling of shame, of degradation. By the other side it would be regarded as <i>impudence</i> or <i>lunacy</i> and rejected as such. We are to such an extent estranged from man\u2019s essential nature that the direct language of this essential nature seems to us a <i>violation of human dignity</i>, whereas the estranged language of material values seems to be the well-justified assertion of human dignity that is self-confident and conscious of itself.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p36\"></a>Although in your eyes your product is an <i>instrument</i>, a <i>means</i>, for taking possession of my product and thus for satisfying your need; yet in my eyes it is the <i>purpose</i> of our exchange. For me, you are rather the means and instrument for producing this object that is my aim, just as conversely you stand in the same relationship to my object. But 1) each of us actually <i>behaves</i> in the way he is regarded by the other. You have actually made yourself the means, the instrument, the producer of <i>your</i> own object in order to gain possession of mine; 2) your own object is for you only the <i>sensuously perceptible covering</i>, the <i>hidden shape</i>, of my object; for its production <i>signifies</i> and seeks to <i>express</i> the <i>acquisition</i> of my object. In fact, therefore, you have become for yourself a <i>means</i>, an <i>instrument</i> of your object, of which your desire is the <i>servant</i>, and you have performed menial services in order that the object shall never again do a favour to your desire. If then our mutual thraldom to the object at the beginning of the process is now seen to be in reality the relationship between <i>master</i> and <i>slave</i>, that is merely the <i>crude</i> and <i>frank</i> expression of our <i>essential</i> relationship.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p37\"></a>Our <i>mutual</i> value is for us the <i>value</i> of our mutual objects. Hence for us man himself is mutually of <i>no value</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p38\"></a>Let us suppose that we had carried out production as human beings. Each of us would have <i>in two ways affirmed</i> himself and the other person. 1) In my <i>production</i> I would have objectified my <i>individuality</i>, its <i>specific character</i>, and therefore enjoyed not only an individual <i>manifestation of my life</i> during the activity, but also when looking at the object I would have the individual pleasure of knowing my personality to be <i>objective</i>, <i>visible to the senses</i> and hence a power <i>beyond all doubt</i>. 2) In your enjoyment or use of my product I would have the <i>direct</i> enjoyment both of being conscious of having satisfied a <i>human</i> need by my work, that is, of having objectified <i>man\u2019s</i> essential nature, and of having thus created an object corresponding to the need of another <i>man\u2019s</i> essential nature. 3) I would have been for you the <i>mediator</i> between you and the species, and therefore would become recognised and felt by you yourself as a completion of your own essential nature and as a necessary part of yourself, and consequently would know myself to be confirmed both in your thought and your love. 4) In the individual expression of my life I would have directly created your expression of your life, and therefore in my individual activity I would have directly <i>confirmed</i> and <i>realised</i> my true nature, my <i>human</i> nature, my <i>communal nature</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p39\"></a>Our products would be so many mirrors in which we saw reflected our essential nature.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p40\"></a>This relationship would moreover be reciprocal; what occurs on my side has also to occur on yours.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p41\"></a>Let us review the various factors as seen in our supposition:</p>", "<p><a id=\"p42\"></a>My work would be a <i>free manifestation of life</i>, hence an <i>enjoyment of life</i>. Presupposing private property, my work is an <i>alienation of life</i>, for I work <i>in order to live</i>, in order to obtain for myself the <i>means</i> of life. My work <i>is not</i> my life.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p43\"></a>Secondly, the <i>specific nature</i> of my individuality, therefore, would be affirmed in my labour, since the latter would be an affirmation of my <i>individual</i> life. Labour therefore would be <i>true</i>, <i>active property</i>. Presupposing private property, my individuality is alienated to such a degree that this <i>activity</i> is instead <i>hateful</i> to me, a <i>torment</i>, and rather the <i>semblance</i> of an activity. Hence, too, it is only a <i>forced</i> activity and one imposed on me only through an <i>external</i> fortuitous need, <i>not</i> through an <i>inner</i>, <i>essential</i> one.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p44\"></a>My labour can appear in my object only as what it is. It cannot appear as something which by its nature it is <i>not</i>. Hence it appears only as the expression of my <i>loss of self</i> and of my <i>powerlessness</i> that is objective, sensuously perceptible, obvious and therefore put beyond all doubt.</p>"], "year": "1844", "sourceBook": "Comments on James Mill, \u201c\u00c9l\u00e9mens d\u2019\u00e9conomie politique\u201d", "author": "Marx", "title": "", "image": "marxy", "info": "Marx (1844): Comments on James Mill, \u201c\u00c9l\u00e9mens d\u2019\u00e9conomie politique\u201d", "idChr": "1.08text"}, {"content": ["<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p0\"></a>Preface</h6>", "<p><a id=\"p1\"></a>I have already announced in the <i>Deutsch-Franz\u00f6sische Jahrb\u00fccher</i> the critique of jurisprudence and political science in the form of a critique of the <i>Hegelian</i> philosophy of law.

This <i>lack of thoroughness</i> is not accidental, since even the <i>critical</i> theologian remains a <i>theologian</i>. Hence, either he has to start from certain presuppositions of philosophy accepted as authoritative; or, if in the process of criticism and as a result of other people\u2019s discoveries doubts about these philosophical presuppositions have arisen in him, he abandons them in a cowardly and unwarrantable fashion, <i>abstracts</i> from them, thus showing his servile dependence on these presuppositions and his resentment at this servility merely in a negative, unconscious and sophistical manner.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>&lt; He does this either by constantly repeating assurances concerning the <i>purity</i> of his own criticism, or by trying to make it seem as though all that was left for criticism to deal with now was some other limited form of criticism outside itself \u2014 say eighteenth-century criticism \u2014 and also the limitations of the <i>masses</i>, in order to divert the observer\u2019s attention as well as his own from the <i>necessary</i> task of settling accounts between criticism and its point of origin \u2014 Hegelian <i>dialectic</i> and German philosophy as a whole \u2014 that is, from this necessary raising of modern criticism above its own limitation and crudity. Eventually, however, whenever discoveries (such as <i>Feuerbach\u2019s)</i> are made regarding the nature of his own philosophic presuppositions, the critical theologian partly makes it appear as if <i>he</i> were the one who had accomplished this, producing that appearance by taking the results of these discoveries and, without being able to develop them, hurling them in the form of <i>catch-phrases</i> at writers still caught in the confines of philosophy. He partly even manages to acquire a sense of his own superiority to such discoveries by asserting in a mysterious way and in a veiled, malicious and sceptical fashion elements of the Hegelian dialectic which he still finds lacking in the criticism of that dialectic (which have not yet been critically served up to him for his use) against such criticism \u2014 not having tried to bring such elements into their proper relation or having been capable of doing so, asserting, say, the category of mediating proof against the category of positive, self-originating truth, [...] [Three words in the manuscript cannot be deciphered.] in a way <i>peculiar</i> to Hegelian dialectic.

Thus, what I <i>am</i> and <i>am capable of</i> is by no means determined by my individuality. I <i>am</i> ugly, but I can buy for myself the <i>most beautiful</i> of women. Therefore I am not <i>ugly</i>, for the effect of ugliness \u2014 its deterrent power \u2014 is nullified by money. I, according to my individual characteristics, am <i>lame</i>, but money furnishes me with twenty-four feet. Therefore I am not lame. I am bad, dishonest, unscrupulous, stupid; but money is honoured, and hence its possessor. Money is the supreme good, therefore its possessor is good. Money, besides, saves me the trouble of being dishonest: I am therefore presumed honest. I am <i>brainless</i>, but money is the <i>real brain</i> of all things and how then should its possessor be brainless? Besides, he can buy clever people for himself, and is he who has power over the clever not more clever than the clever? Do not I, who thanks to money am capable of <i>all</i> that the human heart longs for, possess all human capacities? Does not my money, therefore, transform all my incapacities into their contrary?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p16\"></a>If <i>money</i> is the bond binding me to <i>human</i> life, binding society to me, connecting me with nature and man, is not money the bond of all <i>bonds?</i> Can it not dissolve and bind all ties? Is it not, therefore, also the universal <i>agent of separation?</i> It is the <i>coin</i> that really <i>separates</i> as well as the real <i>binding agent</i> \u2014 the [...] <i>chemical</i> power of society.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p17\"></a>Shakespeare stresses especially two properties of money:</p>", "<p><a id=\"p18\"></a>(1) It is the visible divinity \u2014 the transformation of all human and natural properties into their contraries, the universal confounding and distorting of things: impossibilities are soldered together by it.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p19\"></a>(2) It is the common whore, the common procurer of people and nations.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p20\"></a>The distorting and confounding of all human and natural qualities, the fraternisation of impossibilities \u2014 the <i>divine</i> power of money \u2014 lies in its character as men\u2019s estranged, alienating and self-disposing <i>species-nature</i>.

In effecting this mediation, [money] is the <i>truly creative</i> power.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p23\"></a>No doubt the <i>demand</i> also exists for him who has no money, but his demand is a mere thing of the imagination without effect or existence for me, for a third party, for the [others], and which therefore remains even for me <i>unreal</i> and <i>objectless</i>. The difference between effective demand based on money and ineffective demand based on my need, my passion, my wish, etc., is the difference between <i>being</i> and <i>thinking</i>, between the idea which merely <i>exists</i> within me and the idea which exists as a <i>real object</i> outside of me.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p24\"></a>If I have no money for travel, I have no <i>need</i> \u2014 that is, no real and realisable need \u2014 to travel. If I have the <i>vocation</i> for study but no money for it, I have <i>no</i> vocation for study \u2014 that is, no <i>effective</i>, no <i>true</i> vocation. On the other hand, if I have really <i>no</i> vocation for study but have the will <i>and</i> the money for it, I have an <i>effective</i> vocation for it. Money as the external, universal medium and faculty (not springing from man as man or from human society as society) for turning an <i>image into reality</i> and <i>reality into a mere image</i>, transforms the <i>real essential powers of man and nature</i> into what are merely abstract notions and therefore <i>imperfections</i> and tormenting chimeras, just as it transforms <i>real imperfections and chimeras</i> \u2014 essential powers which are really impotent, which exist only in the imagination of the individual \u2014 into <i>real essential powers</i> and <i>faculties</i>. In the light of this characteristic alone, money is thus the general distorting of <i>individualities</i> which turns them into their opposite and confers contradictory attributes upon their attributes.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p25\"></a>Money, then, appears as this <i>distorting</i> power both against the individual and against the bonds of society, etc., which claim to be <i>entities</i> in themselves. It transforms fidelity into infidelity, love into hate, hate into love, virtue into vice, vice into virtue, servant into master, master into servant, idiocy into intelligence, and intelligence into idiocy.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p26\"></a>Since money, as the existing and active concept of value, confounds and confuses all things, it is the general <i>confounding</i> and <i>confusing</i> of all things \u2014 the world upside-down \u2014 the confounding and confusing of all natural and human qualities.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p27\"></a>He who can buy bravery is brave, though he be a coward. As money is not exchanged for any one specific quality, for any one specific thing, or for any particular human essential power, but for the entire objective world of man and nature, from the standpoint of its possessor it therefore serves to exchange every quality for every other, even contradictory, quality and object: it is the fraternisation of impossibilities.

It is impossible to make such an <i>unpolitical</i> country as Germany regard the <i>partial</i> distress of the factory districts as a matter of general concern, let alone as an affliction of the whole civilised world. The Germans regard this event as if it were of the same nature as any <i>local</i> distress due to flood or famine. Hence the King regards it as due to <i>deficiencies in the administration or in charitable activity</i>. For this reason, and because a few soldiers sufficed to cope with the feeble weavers, the destruction of factories and machinery, too, did not inspire any <i>\u2018alarm\u2019</i> either in the King or the authorities. Indeed, the Cabinet order was not prompted even by <i>religious feeling:</i> it is a very sober expression of the Christian art of statesmanship and of a doctrine which considers that no difficulties can withstand its sole medicine \u2014 \u2018the well-disposed Christian hearts\u2019. Poverty and crime are two great evils; who can cure them? The state and the authorities? No, but the union of all Christian hearts can.\u201d</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>The alleged Prussian denies the King\u2019s <i>\u201calarm\u201d</i> on the grounds, among others, that a few soldiers sufficed to cope with the feeble weavers.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>Therefore, in a country where ceremonial dinners with liberal toasts and liberally foaming champagne \u2014 recall the D\u00fcsseldorf festival \u2014 inspired a royal Cabinet order; [Marx refers to the Cabinet order of the Prussian King Frederick William IV of July 18, 1843, issued in connection with the participation of government officials in a banquet arranged in D\u00fcsseldorf by the liberals to mark the seventh Rhenish Landtag; the order prohibited the government officials to take part in manifestations of this kind.] where <i>not a single</i> soldier was needed to shatter the desires of the <i>entire</i> liberal bourgeoisie for freedom of the press and a constitution; in a country where passive obedience is the order of the day \u2014 can it be that in such a country the necessity to employ armed force against feeble weavers is <i>not an event</i>, and not an <i>alarming</i> event? Moreover, at the first encounter the feeble weavers were victorious. They were suppressed only by subsequent troop reinforcements. Is the uprising of a body of workers less dangerous because it did not require a whole army to suppress it? Let the wise Prussian compare the uprising of the Silesian weavers with the revolts of the English workers, and the Silesian weavers will be seen by him to be <i>strong</i> weavers.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>Starting out from the <i>general</i> relation of <i>politics</i> to <i>social ills</i>, we shall show why the uprising of the weavers could not cause the King any special <i>\u201calarm\u201d</i>. For the time being we shall say only the following: the uprising was not aimed directly against the King of Prussia, but against the bourgeoisie. As an aristocrat and absolute monarch, the King of Prussia cannot love the bourgeoisie; still less can he be alarmed if the submissiveness and impotence of the bourgeoisie is increased because of a tense and difficult relationship between it and the proletariat. Further: the orthodox Catholic is more hostile to the orthodox Protestant than to the atheist, just as the Legitimist is more hostile to the liberal than to the Communist. This is not because the atheist and the Communist are more akin to the Catholic or Legitimist, but because they are more foreign to him than are the Protestant and the liberal, being <i>outside</i> his circle. In the sphere of politics, the King of Prussia, as a politician, has his direct opposite in liberalism. For the King, the proletariat is as little an antithesis as the King is for the proletariat. The proletariat would have to have already attained considerable power for it to stifle the other antipathies and political antitheses and to divert to itself all political enmity. Finally: in view of the well-known character of the King, avid for anything <i>interesting</i> and <i>significant</i>, it must have been a joyful surprise for him to discover this <i>\u201cinteresting\u201d</i> and <i>\u201cmuch discussed\u201d pauperism</i> in his own territory and consequently a new opportunity for making people talk about him. How pleasant for him must have been the news that henceforth he possesses his <i>\u201cown\u201d</i>, royal Prussian <i>pauperism!</i></p>", "<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p6\"></a>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"stea\"><b>***</b></span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a><i>No</i> government in the world has issued <i>regulations</i> regarding pauperism <i>at once</i>, without reaching agreement with the authorities. The English Parliament even sent representatives to all the countries of Europe to learn about the various administrative remedies for pauperism. But insofar as the states have occupied themselves with pauperism, they have either confined themselves to <i>administrative</i> and <i>charitable measures</i>, or they have retreated to less than administrative action and charity.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>Can the state act in any other way?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>The <i>state</i> \u2014 contrary to what the Prussian demands of his King \u2014 will never see in <i>\u201cthe state</i> and the <i>system of society\u201d</i> the source of <i>social maladies</i>. Where political parties exist, each party sees the root of <i>every</i> evil in the fact that instead of itself an opposing party stands at the <i>helm of the state</i>. Even radical and revolutionary politicians seek the root of the evil not in the <i>essential nature</i> of the state, but in a definite <i>state form</i>, which they wish to replace by a <i>different</i> state form.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p10\"></a>From the <i>political</i> point of view, the <i>state</i> and the <i>system of society</i> are not <i>two</i> different things. The state is the system of society. Insofar as the state admits the existence of <i>social</i> defects, it sees their cause either in the <i>laws of nature</i>, which no human power can command, or in <i>private life</i>, which does not depend on the state, or in the <i>inexpedient activity of the administration</i>, which does not depend on it. Thus England sees the cause of poverty in the law of nature by which the population must always be in excess of the means of subsistence. On the other hand, England explains <i>pauperism</i> as due to the <i>bad will of the poor</i>, just as the King of Prussia explains it by the <i>un-Christian feelings of the rich</i>, and just as the Convention explained it by the <i>suspect counter-revolutionary mentality of the property-owners</i>. Therefore England punishes the poor, the King of Prussia admonishes the rich, and the Convention cuts off the heads of the property owners.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p11\"></a>Finally, <i>every</i> state seeks the cause in <i>accidental</i> or <i>deliberate shortcomings of the administration</i>, and therefore it seeks the remedy for its ills <i>in measures</i> of the administration. Why? Precisely because <i>administration</i> is the <i>organising</i> activity of the state.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p12\"></a>The <i>contradiction</i> between the purpose and goodwill of the administration, on the one hand, and its means and possibilities, on the other hand, cannot be abolished by the state without the latter abolishing itself, for it is <i>based</i> on this contradiction. The state is based on the contradiction between <i>public</i> and <i>private life</i>, on the contradiction between <i>general interests</i> and <i>private interests</i>. Hence the <i>administration</i> has to confine itself to a <i>formal</i> and <i>negative</i> activity, for where civil life and its labour begin, there the power of the administration ends. Indeed, confronted by the consequences which arise from the unsocial nature of this civil life, this private ownership, this trade, this industry, this mutual plundering of the various circles of citizens, confronted by all these consequences, <i>impotence</i> is the <i>law of nature</i> of the administration. For this fragmentation, this baseness, this <i>slavery of civil society</i> is the natural foundation on which the <i>modern</i> state rests, just as the <i>civil society of slavery</i> was the natural foundation on which the <i>ancient</i> state rested. The existence of the state and the existence of slavery are inseparable. The ancient state and ancient slavery \u2014 these straightforward <i>classic</i> opposites \u2014 were not more intimately <i>riveted</i> to each other than are the modern state and the modern commercial world, these hypocritical <i>Christian</i> opposites. If the modern state wanted to abolish the <i>impotence</i> of its administration, it would have to abolish the <i>private life</i> of today. But if it wanted to abolish private life, it would have to abolish itself, for it exists <i>only</i> in the contradiction to private life. But no <i>living being</i> believes that the shortcomings of his existence have their basis in the <i>principle</i> of his life, in the essence of his life; everyone believes that their basis lies in circumstances <i>external</i> to his life. <i>Suicide</i> is against nature. Therefore the state cannot believe in the <i>inherent</i> impotence of its administration, i. e., in its own impotence. It can perceive <i>only</i> formal, accidental deficiencies in its administration and try to remedy them. And if these modifications prove fruitless, the conclusion is drawn that social ills are a natural imperfection independent of man, <i>a law of God</i> or \u2014 that the will of private individuals is too spoilt to be able to respond to the good intentions of the administration. And how preposterous these private individuals are! They grumble at the government whenever it restricts their freedom, and at the same time they demand that the government prevent the inevitable results of this freedom!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p13\"></a>The mightier the state, and the <i>more political</i> therefore a country is, the less is it inclined to grasp the <i>general</i> principle of <i>social</i> maladies and to seek their basis in the <i>principle of the state</i>, hence in the <i>present structure of society</i>, the active, conscious and official expression of which is the state. The <i>political</i> mind is a <i>political</i> mind precisely because it thinks <i>within</i> the framework of politics. The keener and more lively it is, the <i>more incapable</i> is it of understanding social ills. The <i>classic</i> period of political intellect is the <i>French Revolution</i>. Far from seeing the source of social shortcomings in the principle of the state, the heroes of the French Revolution instead saw in social defects the source of political evils. Thus, <i>Robespierre</i> saw in great poverty and great wealth only an obstacle to <i>pure democracy</i>. Therefore he wished to establish a universal Spartan frugality. The principle of politics is the <i>will</i>. The more one-sided and, therefore, the more perfected the <i>political</i> mind is, the more does it believe in the <i>omnipotence</i> of the will, the more is it blind to the <i>natural</i> and spiritual <i>limits</i> of the will, and the more incapable is it therefore of discovering the source of social ills. There is no need of further argument against the \u201cPrussian\u2019s\u201d silly hope that <i>\u201cpolitical understanding\u201d</i> is destined \u201cto discover <i>the roots of social distress</i> in Germany\u201d.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p14\"></a>It was foolish to expect from the King of Prussia not only a power such as the Convention and Napoleon together did not possess; it was foolish to expect from him a manner of viewing things that transcends the bounds of <i>all</i> politics and which the wise \u201cPrussian\u201d himself is no closer to possessing than is his King.</p>", "<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p15\"></a>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"stea\"><b>***</b></span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>", "<p><a id=\"p16\"></a>Let us suppose then that the \u201cPrussian\u2019s\u201d remarks about the German Government and the German bourgeoisie \u2014 after all the latter is included in \u201cGerman society\u201d \u2014 are entirely well founded.

The Silesian uprising <i>begins</i> precisely with what the French and English workers\u2019 uprisings <i>end</i>, with consciousness of the nature of the proletariat. The action itself bears the stamp of this <i>superior</i> character. Not only machines, these rivals of the workers, are destroyed, but also <i>ledgers</i>, the titles to property. And while all other movements were aimed primarily only against the <i>owner of the industrial enterprise</i>, the visible enemy, this movement is at the same time directed against the banker, the hidden enemy. Finally, not a single English workers\u2019 uprising was carried out with such courage, thought and endurance.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p24\"></a>As for the educational level or capacity for education of the German workers in general, I call to mind <i>Weitling\u2019s</i> brilliant writings, which as regards theory are often superior even to those of <i>Proudhon</i>, however much they are inferior to the latter in their execution. Where among the bourgeoisie \u2014 including its philosophers and learned writers \u2014 is to be found a book about the emancipation of the bourgeoisie \u2014 <i>political</i> emancipation \u2014 similar to Weitling\u2019s work: <i>Garantien der Harmonie und Freiheit?</i> It is enough to compare the petty, faint-hearted mediocrity of German political literature with this vehement and brilliant literary debut of the German workers, it is enough to compare these gigantic <i>infant shoes</i> of the proletariat with the dwarfish, worn-out political shoes of the German bourgeoisie, and one is bound to prophesy that the <i>German Cinderella</i> will one day have the <i>figure of an athlete</i>. It has to be admitted that the German proletariat is the <i>theoretician</i> of the European proletariat, just as the English proletariat is its <i>economist</i>, and the French proletariat its <i>politician</i>. It has to be admitted that Germany is just as much <i>classically</i> destined for a <i>social</i> revolution as it is incapable of a <i>political</i> one. For, just as the impotence of the German bourgeoisie is the <i>political</i> impotence of Germany, so also the capability of the German proletariat \u2014 even apart from German theory \u2014 represents the <i>social</i> capability of Germany. The disparity between the philosophical and the political development of Germany is not an anomaly. It is an inevitable disparity. A philosophical people can find its corresponding practice only in socialism, hence it is only in the <i>proletariat</i> that it can find the dynamic element of its emancipation.</p>", "<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p25\"></a>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"stea\"><b>***</b></span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>", "<p><a id=\"p26\"></a>Why does the \u201cPrussian\u201d judge the German workers so contemptuously?

The more developed and universal the <i>political</i> understanding of a people, the more does the <i>proletariat</i> \u2014 at any rate at the beginning of the movement \u2014 squander its forces in senseless, useless revolts, which are drowned in blood. Because it thinks in the framework of politics, the proletariat sees the cause of all evils in the <i>will</i>, and all means of remedy in <i>violence</i> and in the <i>overthrow</i> of a <i>particular</i> form of state. The proof: the first uprisings of the <i>French</i> proletariat. [45] The Lyons workers believed that they were pursuing only political aims, that they were only soldiers of the republic, whereas actually they were soldiers of socialism.

The \u201cPrussian\u201d therefore should have said: smothering in blood will smother incomprehension and procure a proper current of air for the understanding.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p33\"></a>The \u201cPrussian\u201d prophesies the smothering of uprisings which break out in <i>\u201cdisastrous isolation of people from the community</i>, and in the <i>separation of their thoughts from social principles\u201d</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p34\"></a>We have shown that the Silesian uprising occurred by no means in circumstances of the separation of thoughts from social principles.

This work became possible only owing to the work of Proudhon himself, just as Proudhon\u2019s criticism has as its premise the criticism of the mercantile system by the physiocrats, Adam Smith\u2019s criticism of the physiocrats, Ricardo\u2019s criticism of Adam Smith, and the works of Fourier and Saint-Simon.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p2\"></a>All treatises on political economy take private property for granted. This basic premise is for them an incontestable fact to which they devote no further investigation, indeed a fact which is spoken about only <i>\u201caccidentellement\u201d</i>, as <i>Say</i> naively admits. [J.-B. Say, <i>Trait\u00e9 d\u2019economie politique</i>, t. II, p. 471.] But Proudhon makes a critical investigation \u2014 the first resolute, ruthless, and at the same time scientific investigation \u2014 of the basis of political economy, <i>private property</i>. This is the great scientific advance he made, an advance which revolutionises political economy and for the first time makes a real science of political economy possible. Proudhon\u2019s treatise <i>Qu\u2019est-ce que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9?</i> is as important for modern political economy as Siey\u00e8s\u2019 work <i>Qu\u2019est-ce que le tiers \u00e9tat?</i> [<i>What Is the Third Estate?</i>] for modern politics.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>Proudhon does not consider the further creations of private property, e.g., wages, trade, value, price, money, etc., as forms of private property in themselves, as they are considered, for example, in the <i>Deutsch-Franz\u00f6sische Jahrb\u00fccher</i> (see <i>Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy</i> by F. Engels), but uses these economic premises in arguing against the political economists; this is fully in keeping with his historically justified standpoint to which we referred above.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>Accepting the relationships of private property as human and rational, political economy operates in permanent contradiction to its basic premise, private property, a contradiction analogous to that of the theologian who continually gives a human interpretation to religious conceptions, and by that very fact comes into constant conflict with his basic premise, the superhuman character of religion. Thus in political economy wages appear at the beginning as the proportional share of the product due to labour. Wages and profit on capital stand in the most friendly, mutually stimulating, apparently most human relationship to each other. Afterwards it turns out that they stand in the most hostile relationship, in inverse proportion to each other. Value is determined at the beginning in an apparently rational way, by the cost of production of an object and by its social usefulness. Later it turns out that value is determined quite fortuitously and that it does not need to bear any relation to either the cost of production or social usefulness. The size of wages is determined at the beginning by <i>free</i> agreement between the free worker and the free capitalist. Later it turns out that the worker is compelled to allow the capitalist to determine it, just as the capitalist is compelled to fix it as low as possible. <i>Freedom</i> of the contracting parties has been supplanted by <i>compulsion</i>. The same holds good of trade and all other economic relationships. The economists themselves occasionally feel these contradictions, the development of which is the main content of the conflict between them. When, however, the economists become conscious of these contradictions, <i>they themselves</i> attack <i>private property</i> in one or other <i>particular</i> form as the falsifier of what is in itself (i.e., in their imagination) rational wages, in itself rational value, in itself rational trade. Adam Smith, for instance, occasionally polemises against the capitalists, Destutt de Tracy against the money-changers, Simonde de Sismondi against the factory system, Ricardo against landed property, and nearly all modern economists against the <i>non-industrial</i> capitalists, among whom property appears as a mere <i>consumer</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>Thus, as an exception \u2014 when they attack some special abuse \u2014 the economists occasionally stress the semblance of humanity in economic relations, but sometimes, and as a rule, they take these relations precisely in their clearly pronounced <i>difference</i> from the human, in their strictly economic sense. They stagger about within this contradiction completely unaware of it.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>Now <i>Proudhon</i> has put an end to this unconsciousness once for all. He takes the <i>human semblance</i> of the economic relations seriously and sharply opposes it to their <i>inhuman reality</i>. He forces them to be in reality what they imagine themselves to be, or rather to give up their own idea of themselves and confess their real inhumanity. He therefore consistently depicts as the falsifier of economic relations not this or that particular kind of private property, as other economists do, but private property as such and in its entirety. He has done all that criticism of political economy from the standpoint of political economy can do.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>Herr Edgar, who wishes to <i>characterise</i> the <i>standpoint</i> of the treatise <i>Qu\u2019est-ce que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9?</i>, naturally does not say a word either of political economy or of the distinctive character of this book, which is precisely that it has made the <i>essence of private property</i> the vital question of political economy and jurisprudence. This is all self-evident for Critical Criticism. Proudhon, it says, has done nothing new by his negation of private property. He has only let out a secret which Critical Criticism did not want to divulge.</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p8\"></a>\u201cProudhon,\u201d Herr Edgar continues immediately after his characterising translation, \u201ctherefore finds something absolute, an eternal foundation in history, a god that guides mankind \u2014 justice.\u201d</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>Proudhon\u2019s book, written in France in 1840, does not adopt the standpoint of German development in 1844. It is Proudhon\u2019s standpoint, a standpoint which is shared by countless diametrically opposed French writers, which therefore gives Critical Criticism the advantage of having characterised the most contradictory standpoints with a single stroke of the pen. Incidentally, to be relieved from this Absolute in history as well one has only to apply consistently the law formulated by Proudhon himself, that of the implementation of justice by its negation. If Proudhon does not carry consistency as far as that, it is only because he had the misfortune of being born a Frenchman, not a German.</p>"], "year": "1844", "sourceBook": "The Holy Family: A Critique of Critical Criticism", "author": "Marx", "title": "On Proudhon", "image": "marxy", "info": "Marx (1844): The Holy Family: A Critique of Critical Criticism", "idChr": "1.11.01text"}, {"content": ["<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p0\"></a>Alienation and Social Classes</h6>", "<p><a id=\"p1\"></a>Proletariat and wealth are opposites; as such they form a single whole.

The latter feels annihilated in estrangement; it sees in it its own powerlessness and the reality of an inhuman existence. It is, to use an expression of Hegel, in its abasement the <i>indignation</i> at that abasement, an indignation to which it is necessarily driven by the contradiction between its human nature and its condition of life, which is the outright, resolute and comprehensive negation of that nature.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>Within this antithesis the private property-owner is therefore the conservative side, the proletarian the destructive side. From the former arises the action of preserving the antithesis, from the latter the action of annihilating it.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>Indeed private property drives itself in its economic movement towards its own dissolution, but only through a development which does not depend on it, which is unconscious and which takes place against the will of private property by the very nature of things, only inasmuch as it produces the proletariat as proletariat, poverty which is conscious of its spiritual and physical poverty, dehumanisation which is conscious of its dehumanisation, and therefore self-abolishing. The proletariat executes the sentence that private property pronounces on itself by producing the proletariat, just as it executes the sentence that wage-labour pronounces on itself by producing wealth for others and poverty for itself. When the proletariat is victorious, it by no means becomes the absolute side of society, for it is victorious only by abolishing itself and its opposite. Then the proletariat disappears as well as the opposite which determines it, private property.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>When socialist writers ascribe this world-historic role to the proletariat, it is not at all, as Critical Criticism pretends to believe, because they regard the proletarians as <i>gods</i>. Rather the contrary. Since in the fully-formed proletariat the abstraction of all humanity, even of the <i>semblance</i> of humanity, is practically complete; since the conditions of life of the proletariat sum up all the conditions of life of society today in their most inhuman form; since man has lost himself in the proletariat, yet at the same time has not only gained theoretical consciousness of that loss, but through urgent, no longer removable, no longer disguisable, absolutely imperative <i>need</i> \u2014 the practical expression of <i>necessity</i> \u2014 is driven directly to revolt against this inhumanity, it follows that the proletariat can and must emancipate itself. But it cannot emancipate itself without abolishing the conditions of its own life. It cannot abolish the conditions of its own life without abolishing <i>all</i> the inhuman conditions of life of society today which are summed up in its own situation.

It is a question of <i>what the proletariat is</i>, and what, in accordance with this being, it will historically be compelled to do. Its aim and historical action is visibly and irrevocably foreshadowed in its own life situation as well as in the whole organisation of bourgeois society today.

Herr Edgar achieves this Critically Critical remark by translating <i>\u201cvaleur\u201d</i> [value] by <i>\u201cGeltung\u201d</i> [validity] so that he can use the word for validity of a legal principle in the same sense as for the commercial value of a product of labour. He achieves it by identifying empty length of time with time filled with labour. Had Proudhon said that time cannot change a fly into an elephant, Critical Criticism could have said with the same justification: he has therefore no right to make labour time the measure of wages.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>Even Critical Criticism must be capable of grasping that the <i>labour time expended</i> on the production of an object is included in the <i>cost of production</i> of that object, that the <i>cost of production</i> of an object is what it <i>costs</i>, and therefore what it can be <i>sold</i> for, abstraction being made of the influence of <i>competition</i>. Besides the labour time and the material of labour, economists include in the cost of production the rent paid to the owner of the land, interest and the profit of the capitalist. The latter are excluded by Proudhon because he excludes private property. Hence there remain only the labour time and the expenses. By making labour time, the immediate existence of human activity as activity, the measure of wages and the determinant of the value of the product, Proudhon makes the human side the decisive factor. In old political economy, on the other hand, the decisive factor was the material power of capital and of landed property. In other words, Proudhon reinstates man in his rights, but still in an economic and therefore contradictory way. How right he is from the standpoint of political economy can be seen from the fact that <i>Adam Smith</i>, the founder of modern political economy, in the very first pages of his book, <i>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</i>, develops the idea that <i>before</i> the invention of private property, that is to say, presupposing the <i>non-existence of private property</i>, <i>labour time</i> was the measure of <i>wages</i> and of the <i>value of the product of labour</i>, which was not yet distinguished from wages.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>But even let Critical Criticism suppose for an instant that Proudhon did not proceed from the premise of wages. Does it believe that the <i>time</i> which the production of an object requires will <i>ever</i> not be an essential factor in the <i>\u201cvalidity\u201d</i> of the object? Does it believe that time will lose its <i>costliness?</i></p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>As far as immediate material production is concerned, the decision whether an object is to be produced or not, i.e., the decision on the <i>value</i> of the object, will depend essentially on the labour time required for its production. For it depends on time whether society has time to develop in a human way.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>And even as far as <i>intellectual</i> production is concerned, must I not, if I proceed reasonably in other respects, consider the time necessary for the production of an intellectual work when I determine its scope, its character and its plan? Otherwise I risk at least that the object that is in my idea will never become an object in reality, and can therefore acquire only the value of an imaginary object, i.e., an <i>imaginary value</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p10\"></a>The criticism of political economy from the standpoint of political economy recognises all the essential determinants of human activity, but only in an estranged, alienated form. Here, for example, it converts the importance of time for <i>human labour</i> into its importance for <i>wages</i>, for wage-labour.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p11\"></a>Herr Edgar continues:</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p12\"></a>\u201cIn order to force talent to accept that measure, Proudhon <i>misuses</i> the concept of <i>free contract</i> and asserts that society and its individual members have the right to reject the products of talent.\u201d</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p13\"></a>Among the <i>followers of Fourier</i> and <i>Saint-Simon</i>, talent puts forward exaggerated <i>fee claims</i> on an economic basis and makes its imagined notion of its infinite value the measure of the <i>exchange value</i> of its products.

I therefore declare apples, pears, almonds, etc., to be mere forms of existence, <i>modi</i>, of <i>\u201cFruit\u201d</i>. My finite understanding supported by my senses does of course distinguish an apple from a pear and a pear from an almond, but my speculative reason declares these sensuous differences inessential and irrelevant. It sees in the apple <i>the same</i> as in the pear, and in the pear the same as in the almond, namely <i>\u201cFruit\u201d</i>. Particular real fruits are no more than <i>semblances</i> whose true essence is <i>\u201cthe</i> substance\u201d \u2014 <i>\u201cFruit\u201d</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>By this method one attains no particular <i>wealth of definition</i>.

For every mineral the speculative mineralogist says <i>\u201cthe</i> Mineral\u201d, and his science is reduced to repeating this word as many times as there are real minerals.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>Having reduced the different real fruits to the one \u201cfruit\u201d of abstraction \u2014 <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d, speculation must, in order to attain some semblance of real content, try somehow to find its way back from <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d, from the <i>Substance</i> to the <i>diverse</i>, ordinary real fruits, the pear, the apple, the almond, etc. It is as hard to produce real fruits from the abstract idea <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d as it is easy to produce this abstract idea from real fruits. Indeed, it is impossible to arrive at the <i>opposite</i> of an abstraction without <i>relinquishing</i> the abstraction.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>The speculative philosopher therefore relinquishes the abstraction <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d, but in a <i>speculative</i>, <i>mystical</i> fashion \u2014 with the appearance of <i>not</i> relinquishing it. Thus it is really only in appearance that he rises above his abstraction. He argues somewhat as follows:</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>If apples, pears, almonds and strawberries are really nothing but <i>\u201cthe</i> Substance\u201d, <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d, the question arises: Why does <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d manifest itself to me sometimes as an apple, sometimes as a pear, sometimes as an almond? Why this <i>semblance of diversity</i> which so obviously contradicts my speculative conception of Unity, <i>\u201cthe</i> Substance\u201d, <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>This, answers the speculative philosopher, is because <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d is not dead, undifferentiated, motionless, but a living, self-differentiating, moving essence. The diversity of the ordinary fruits is significant not only for my sensuous understanding, but also for <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d itself and for speculative reason. The different ordinary fruits are different manifestations of the life of the <i>\u201cone</i> Fruit\u201d; they are crystallisations of <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d itself. Thus in the apple <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d gives itself an apple-like existence, in the pear a pear-like existence. We must therefore no longer say, as one might from the standpoint of the Substance: a pear is <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d, an apple is <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d, an almond is <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d, but rather <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d presents itself as a pear, <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d presents itself as an apple, <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d presents itself as an almond; and the differences which distinguish apples, pears and almonds from one another are the self-differentiations of <i>\u201cthe Fruit\u201d</i> and make the particular fruits different members of the life-process of <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d. Thus <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d is no longer an empty undifferentiated unity; it is oneness as <i>allness</i>, as <i>\u201ctotality\u201d</i> of fruits, which constitute an <i>\u201corganically linked series of members\u201d</i>. In every member of that series <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d gives itself a more developed, more explicit existence, until finally, as the <i>\u201csummary\u201d</i> of all fruits, it is at the same time the living unity which contains all those fruits dissolved in itself just as it produces them from within itself, just as, for instance, all the limbs of the body are constantly dissolved in and constantly produced out of the blood.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>We see that if the Christian religion knows only one Incarnation of God, speculative philosophy has as many incarnations as there are things, just as it has here in every fruit an incarnation of the Substance, of the Absolute Fruit. The main interest for the speculative philosopher is therefore to produce the <i>existence</i> of the real ordinary fruits and to say in some mysterious way that there are apples, pears, almonds and raisins. But the apples, pears, almonds and raisins that we rediscover in the speculative world are nothing but <i>semblances</i> of apples, <i>semblances</i> of pears, <i>semblances</i> of almonds and <i>semblances</i> of raisins, for they are moments in the life of <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d, this abstract creation of the mind, and therefore themselves abstract creations of the mind. Hence what is delightful in this speculation is to rediscover all the real fruits there, but as fruits which have a higher mystical significance, which have grown out of the ether of your brain and not out of the material earth, which are incarnations of <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d, of the <i>Absolute Subject</i>. When you return from the abstraction, the <i>supernatural</i> creation of the mind, <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d, to real natural fruits, you give on the contrary the natural fruits a supernatural significance and transform them into sheer abstractions. Your main interest is then to point out the <i>unity</i> of <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d in all the manifestations of its life \u2014 the apple, the pear, the almond \u2014 that is, to show the <i>mystical interconnection</i> between these fruits, how in each one of them <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d realises itself by <i>degrees</i> and <i>necessarily</i> progresses, for instance, from its existence as a raisin to its existence as an almond. Hence the value of the ordinary fruits <i>no longer</i> consists in their <i>natural</i> qualities, <i>but</i> in their <i>speculative</i> quality, which gives each of them a definite place in the life-process of <i>\u201cthe</i> Absolute Fruit\u201d.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>The ordinary man does not think he is saying anything extraordinary when he states that there are apples and pears. But when the philosopher expresses their existence in the speculative way he says something <i>extraordinary</i>. He performs a <i>miracle</i> by producing the real <i>natural objects</i>, the apple, the pear, etc., out of the unreal <i>creation of the mind \u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d, i.e., by <i>creating</i> those fruits out of his <i>own abstract reason</i>, which he considers as an Absolute Subject outside himself, represented here as <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d. And in regard to every object the existence of which he expresses, he accomplishes an act of creation.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p10\"></a>It goes without saying that the speculative philosopher accomplishes this continuous creation only by presenting universally known qualities of the apple, the pear, etc., which exist in reality, as determining features <i>invented</i> by him, by giving the <i>names</i> of the real things to what abstract reason alone can create, to abstract formulas of reason, finally, by declaring his <i>own</i> activity, by which <i>he passes</i> from the idea of an apple to the idea of a pear, to be the <i>self-activity</i> of the Absolute Subject, <i>\u201cthe</i> Fruit\u201d.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p11\"></a>In the speculative way of speaking, this operation is called comprehending <i>Substance</i> as <i>Subject</i>, as an <i>inner process</i>, as an <i>Absolute Person</i>, and this comprehension constitutes the essential character of <i>Hegel\u2019s</i> method.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p12\"></a>These preliminary remarks were necessary to make Herr Szeliga intelligible. Only now, after dissolving real relations, e.g., law and civilisation, in the category of mystery and thereby making <i>\u201cMystery\u201d</i> into Substance, does he rise to the true speculative, <i>Hegelian</i> height and transforms <i>\u201cMystery\u201d</i> into a self-existing Subject <i>incarnating</i> itself in real situations and persons so that the manifestations of its life are countesses, marquises, grisettes, porters, notaries, charlatans, and love intrigues, balls, wooden doors, etc. Having produced the category <i>\u201cMystery\u201d</i> out of the real world, he produces the real world out of this category.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p13\"></a>The mysteries of <i>speculative construction</i> in Herr Szeliga\u2019s presentation will be all the <i>more visibly</i> disclosed as he has an indisputable <i>double</i> advantage over <i>Hegel</i>. On the one hand, Hegel with masterly sophistry is able to present as a process of the imagined creation of the mind itself, of the Absolute Subject, the process by which the philosopher through sensory perception and imagination passes from one subject to another. On the other hand, however, Hegel very often gives a <i>real</i> presentation, embracing the <i>thing</i> itself, within the <i>speculative</i> presentation. This real development <i>within</i> the speculative development misleads the reader into considering the speculative development as real and the real as speculative.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p14\"></a>With Herr Szeliga both these difficulties vanish. His dialectics have no hypocrisy or dissimulation. He performs his tricks with the most laudable honesty and the most ingenuous straightforwardness. But then he <i>nowhere</i> develops any <i>real content</i>, so that his speculative construction is free from all disturbing accessories, from all ambiguous disguises, and appeals to the eye in its naked beauty. In Herr Szeliga we also see a brilliant illustration of how speculation on the one hand apparently freely creates its object <i>a priori</i> out of itself and, on the other hand, precisely because it wishes to get rid by sophistry of the rational and natural dependence on the <i>object</i>, falls into the most irrational and unnatural <i>bondage</i> to the object, whose most accidental and most individual attributes it is obliged to construe as absolutely necessary and general.</p>"], "year": "1844", "sourceBook": "The Holy Family: A Critique of Critical Criticism", "author": "Marx", "title": "On Idealist Philosophy", "image": "marxy", "info": "Marx (1844): The Holy Family: A Critique of Critical Criticism", "idChr": "1.11.04text"}, {"content": ["<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p0\"></a>The Jewish Question Revisited</h6>", "<p><a id=\"p1\"></a>Just as <i>industrial activity</i> is not abolished when the <i>privileges of the trades</i>, guilds and corporations are abolished, but, on the contrary, real <i>industry</i> begins only after the abolition of these privileges; just as <i>ownership of the land</i> is not abolished when <i>privileged</i> landownership is abolished, but, on the contrary, begins its universal movement only with the abolition of privileges and with the free division and free sale of land; just as <i>trade</i> is not abolished by the abolition of <i>trade privileges</i>, but finds its true realisation in free trade; so religion develops in its <i>practical</i> universality only where there is no <i>privileged</i> religion (cf. the North American States).</p>", "<p><a id=\"p2\"></a>The modern <i>\u201cpublic system\u201d</i>, the developed modern state, is not based, as <i>Criticism</i> thinks, on a society of privileges, but on a society in which <i>privileges have been abolished</i> and <i>dissolved</i>, on developed <i>civil society</i> in which the vital elements which were still politically bound under the privilege system have been set free. Here <i>no \u201cprivileged exclusivity\u201d</i>, stands opposed either to any other exclusivity or to the public system.

In the same way <i>civil society</i> as a whole is this war against one another of all individuals, who are no longer isolated from one another by anything but their <i>individuality</i>, and the universal unrestrained movement of the elementary forces of life freed from the fetters of privilege. The contradiction between the <i>democratic representative state</i> and <i>civil society</i> is the completion of the <i>classic</i> contradiction between public <i>commonweal</i> and <i>slavery</i>. In the modern world each person is <i>at the same time</i> a member of slave society and of the public commonweal.

To the dissolution of the <i>political</i> existence of these elements, as for example, the dissolution of <i>property</i> by the abolition of the <i>property qualification for electors</i>, the dissolution of <i>religion</i> by the abolition of the <i>state church</i>, to this proclamation of their civil death corresponds their most vigorous life, which henceforth obeys its own laws undisturbed and develops to its full scope.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a><i>Anarchy</i> is the law of civil society emancipated from divisive privileges, and the <i>anarchy of civil society</i> is the basis of the modern <i>public system</i>, just as the public system in its turn is the guarantee of that anarchy.

The <i>specific property</i> of the atom is that it has no properties and is therefore not connected with beings outside it by any relationship determined by its own <i>natural necessity</i>. The atom <i>has no needs</i>, it is <i>self-sufficient;</i> the world outside it is an absolute <i>vacuum</i>, i.e., is contentless, senseless, meaningless, just because the atom has <i>all fullness</i> in itself. The egoistic individual in civil society may in his non-sensuous imagination and lifeless abstraction inflate himself into an <i>atom</i>, i.e., into an unrelated, self-sufficient, wantless, <i>absolutely full</i>, blessed being. Unblessed <i>sensuous reality</i> does not bother about his imagination, each of his senses compels him to believe in the existence of the world and of individuals outside him, and even his profane stomach reminds him every day that the world <i>outside</i> him is not <i>empty</i>, but is what really <i>fills</i>. Every activity and property of his being, every one of his vital urges, becomes a <i>need</i>, a <i>necessity</i>, which his <i>self-seeking</i> transforms into seeking for other things and human beings outside him. But since the need of one individual has no self-evident meaning for another egoistic individual capable of satisfying that need, and therefore no direct connection with its satisfaction, each individual has to create this connection; it thus becomes the intermediary between the need of another and the objects of this need.

He is unable to explain these facts, and the hypothesis of universal reason made manifest is ready to hand. Nothing is easier than to invent mystical causes, i.e. phrases in which common sense is lacking.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>But in admitting his total incomprehension of the historical development of mankind \u2014 and he admits as much in making use of high-flown expressions such as universal reason, God, etc. \u2014 does not Mr Proudhon admit, implicitly and of necessity, his inability to understand <i>economic development?</i></p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>What is society, irrespective of its form? The product of man\u2019s interaction upon man. Is man free to choose this or that form of society? By no means. If you assume a given state of development of man\u2019s productive faculties, you will have a corresponding form of commerce and consumption. If you assume given stages of development in production, commerce or consumption, you will have a corresponding form of social constitution, a corresponding organisation, whether of the family, of the estates or of the classes \u2014 in a word, a corresponding civil society. If you assume this or that civil society, you will have this or that political system, which is but the official expression of civil society. This is something Mr Proudhon will never understand, for he imagines he\u2019s doing something great when he appeals from the state to civil society, i.e. to official society from the official epitome of society.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>Needless to say, man is not free to choose <i>his productive forces</i> \u2014 upon which his whole history is based \u2014 for every productive force is an acquired force, the product of previous activity. Thus the productive forces are the result of man\u2019s practical energy, but that energy is in turn circumscribed by the conditions in which man is placed by the productive forces already acquired, by the form of society which exists before him, which he does not create, which is the product of the preceding generation. The simple fact that every succeeding generation finds productive forces acquired by the preceding generation and which serve it as the raw material of further production, engenders a relatedness in the history of man, engenders a history of mankind, which is all the more a history of mankind as man\u2019s productive forces, and hence his social relations, have expanded. From this it can only be concluded that the social history of man is never anything else than the history of his individual development, whether he is conscious of this or not. His material relations form the basis of all his relations. These material relations are but the necessary forms in which his material and individual activity is realised.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>Mr Proudhon confuses ideas and things. Man never renounces what he has gained, but this does not mean that he never renounces the form of society in which he has acquired certain productive forces. On the contrary. If he is not to be deprived of the results obtained or to forfeit the fruits of civilisation, man is compelled to change all his traditional social forms as soon as the mode of commerce ceases to correspond to the productive forces acquired. Here I use the word <i>commerce</i> in its widest sense \u2014 as we would say <i>Verkehr</i> in German. For instance, privilege, the institution of guilds and corporations, the regulatory system of the Middle Ages, were the only social relations that corresponded to the acquired productive forces and to the pre-existing social conditions from which those institutions had emerged. Protected by the corporative and regulatory system, capital had accumulated, maritime trade had expanded, colonies had been founded \u2014 and man would have lost the very fruits of all this had he wished to preserve the forms under whose protection those fruits had ripened. And, indeed, two thunderclaps occurred, the revolutions of 1640 and of 1688. In England, all the earlier economic forms, the social relations corresponding to them, and the political system which was the official expression of the old civil society, were destroyed. Thus, the economic forms in which man produces, consumes and exchanges are <i>transitory and historical</i>. With the acquisition of new productive faculties man changes his mode of production and with the mode of production he changes all the economic relations which were but the necessary relations of that particular mode of production.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>It is this that Mr Proudhon has failed to understand, let alone demonstrate. Unable to follow the real course of history, Mr Proudhon provides a phantasmagoria which he has the presumption to present as a dialectical phantasmagoria. He no longer feels any need to speak of the seventeenth, eighteenth or nineteenth centuries, for his history takes place in the nebulous realm of the imagination and soars high above time and place. In a word, it is Hegelian trash, it is not history, it is not profane history \u2014 history of mankind, but sacred history \u2014 history of ideas. As seen by him, man is but the instrument used by the idea or eternal reason in order to unfold itself. The <i>evolutions</i> of which Mr Proudhon speaks are presumed to be evolutions such as take place in the mystical bosom of the absolute idea. If the veil of this mystical language be rent, it will be found that what Mr Proudhon gives us is the order in which economic categories are arranged within his mind. It would require no great effort on my part to prove to you that this arrangement is the arrangement of a very disorderly mind.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>Mr Proudhon opens his book with a dissertation on value which is his hobby-horse. For the time being I shall not embark upon an examination of that dissertation.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p10\"></a>The series of eternal reason\u2019s economic evolutions begins with the <i>division of labour</i>. For Mr Proudhon, the division of labour is something exceedingly simple. But was not the caste system a specific division of labour? And was not the corporative system another division of labour? And is not the division of labour in the manufacturing system, which began in England in the middle of the seventeenth century and ended towards the end of the eighteenth century, likewise entirely distinct from the division of labour in big industry, in modern industry?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p11\"></a>Mr Proudhon is so far from the truth that he neglects to do what even profane economists do. In discussing the division of labour, he feels no need to refer to the world <i>market</i>. Well! Must not the division of labour in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, when there were as yet no colonies, when America was still non-existent for Europe, and when Eastern Asia existed only through the mediation of Constantinople, have been utterly different from the division of labour in the seventeenth century, when colonies were already developed?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p12\"></a>And that is not all. Is the whole internal organisation of nations, are their international relations, anything but the expression of a given division of labour? And must they not change as the division of labour changes?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p13\"></a>Mr Proudhon has so little understood the question of the division of labour that he does not even mention the separation of town and country which occurred in Germany, for instance, between the ninth and twelfth centuries. Thus, to Mr Proudhon, that separation must be an eternal law because he is unaware either of its origin or of its development. Throughout his book he speaks as though this creation of a given mode of production were to last till the end of time. All that Mr Proudhon says about the division of labour is but a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and a very superficial and very incomplete r\u00e9sum\u00e9 at that, of what Adam Smith and a thousand others said before him.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p14\"></a>The second evolution is <i>machinery</i>. With Mr Proudhon, the relation between the division of labour and machinery is a wholly mystical one. Each one of the modes of the division of labour had its specific instruments of production. For instance, between the mid-seventeenth and mid-eighteenth century man did not make everything by hand. He had tools and very intricate ones, such as looms, ships, levers, etc., etc.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p15\"></a>Thus nothing could be more absurd than to see machinery as deriving from the division of labour in general.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p16\"></a>In passing I should also point out that, not having understood the historical origin of machinery, Mr. Proudhon has still less understood its development. Up till 1825 \u2014 when the first general crisis occurred \u2014 it might be said that the requirements of consumption as a whole were growing more rapidly than production, and that the development of machinery was the necessary consequence of the needs of the market. Since 1825, the invention and use of machinery resulted solely from the war between masters and workmen. But this is true only of England. As for the European nations, they were compelled to use machinery by the competition they were encountering from the English, in their home markets as much as in the world market. Finally, where North America was concerned, the introduction of machinery was brought about both by competition with other nations and by scarcity of labour, i.e. by the disproportion between the population and the industrial requirements of North America. From this you will be able to see what wisdom Mr Proudhon evinces when he conjures up the spectre of competition as the third evolution, as the antithesis of machinery!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p17\"></a>Finally, and generally speaking, it is truly absurd to make <i>machinery</i> an economic category alongside the division of labour, competition, credit, etc.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p18\"></a>Machinery is no more an economic category than the ox who draws the plough. The present <i>use</i> of machinery is one of the relations of our present economic system, but the way in which machinery is exploited is quite distinct from the machinery itself. Powder is still powder, whether you use it to wound a man or to dress his wounds.</p>", "<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p19\"></a>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"stea\"><b>***</b></span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>", "<p><a id=\"p20\"></a>Thus Mr Proudhon, chiefly because he doesn\u2019t know history, fails to see that, in developing his productive faculties, i.e. in living, man develops certain inter-relations, and that the nature of these relations necessarily changes with the modification and the growth of the said productive faculties. He fails to see that <i>economic categories</i> are but <i>abstractions</i> of those real relations, that they are truths only in so far as those relations continue to exist. Thus he falls into the error of bourgeois economists who regard those economic categories as eternal laws and not as historical laws which are laws only for a given historical development, a specific development of the productive forces. Thus, instead of regarding politico-economic categories as abstractions of actual social relations that are transitory and historical, Mr Proudhon, by a mystical inversion, sees in the real relations only the embodiment of those abstractions. Those abstractions are themselves formulas which have been slumbering in the bosom of God the Father since the beginning of the world.</p>", "<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p21\"></a>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"stea\"><b>***</b></span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>", "<p><a id=\"p22\"></a>Mr Proudhon understands perfectly well that men manufacture worsted, linens and silks; and whatever credit is due for understanding such a trifle! What Mr Proudhon does not understand is that, according to their faculties, men also produce the <i>social relations</i> in which they produce worsted and linens. Still less does Mr Proudhon understand that those who produce social relations in conformity with their material productivity also produce the <i>ideas</i>, <i>categories</i>, i.e. the ideal abstract expressions of those same social relations. Indeed, the categories are no more eternal than the relations they express. They are historical and transitory products. To Mr Proudhon, on the contrary, the prime cause consists in abstractions and categories. According to him it is these and not men which make history. <i>The abstraction</i>, <i>the category regarded as such</i>, i.e. as distinct from man and his material activity, is, of course, immortal, immutable, impassive. It is nothing but an entity of pure reason, which is only another way of saying that an abstraction, regarded as such, is abstract. An admirable <i>tautology!</i></p>", "<p><a id=\"p23\"></a>Hence, to Mr Proudhon, economic relations, seen in the form of categories, are eternal formulas without origin or progress.</p>", "<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p24\"></a>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"stea\"><b>***</b></span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>", "<p><a id=\"p25\"></a>Hence Mr Proudhon is necessarily <i>doctrinaire</i>. The historical movement by which the present world is convulsed resolves itself, so far as he is concerned, into the problem of discovering the right balance, the synthesis of two bourgeois thoughts. Thus, by subtlety, the clever fellow discovers God\u2019s secret thought, the unity of two isolated thoughts which are isolated thoughts only because Mr Proudhon has isolated them from practical life, from present-day production, which is the combination of the realities they express. In place of the great historical movement which is born of the conflict between the productive forces already acquired by man, and his social relations which no longer correspond to those productive forces, in the place of the terrible wars now imminent between the various classes of a nation and between the various nations, in place of practical and violent action on the part of the masses, which is alone capable of resolving those conflicts, in place of that movement \u2014 vast, prolonged and complex \u2014 Mr Proudhon puts the cacky-dauphin movement of his own mind. Thus it is the savants, the men able to filch from God his inmost thoughts, who make history. All the lesser fry have to do is put their revelations into practice.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p26\"></a>Now you will understand why Mr Proudhon is the avowed enemy of all political movements. For him, the solution of present-day problems does not consist in public action but in the dialectical rotations of his brain. Because to him the categories are the motive force, it is not necessary to change practical life in order to change the categories; on the contrary, it is necessary to change the categories, whereupon actual society will change as a result.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p27\"></a>In his desire to reconcile contradictions Mr Proudhon does not ask himself whether the very basis of those contradictions ought not to be subverted. He is exactly like the political doctrinaire who wants a king and a chamber of deputies and a chamber of peers as integral parts of social life, as eternal categories. Only he seeks a new formula with which to balance those powers (whose balance consists precisely in the actual movement in which one of those powers is now the conqueror now the slave of the other). In the eighteenth century, for instance, a whole lot of mediocre minds busied themselves with finding the true formula with which to maintain a balance between the social estates, the nobility, the king, the parliaments, etc., and the next day there was neither king, nor parliament, nor nobility. The proper balance between the aforesaid antagonisms consisted in the convulsion of all the social relations which served as a basis for those feudal entities and for the antagonism between those feudal entities.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p28\"></a>Because Mr Proudhon posits on the one hand eternal ideas, the categories of pure reason, and, on the other, man and his practical life which, according to him, is the practical application of these categories, you will find in him from the very outset a <i>dualism</i> between life and ideas, between soul and body \u2014 a dualism which recurs in many forms. So you now see that the said antagonism is nothing other than Mr Proudhon\u2019s inability to understand either the origin or the profane history of the categories he has deified.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p29\"></a>My letter is already too long for me to mention the absurd case Mr Proudhon is conducting against communism. For the present you will concede that a man who has failed to understand the present state of society must be even less able to understand either the movement which tends to overturn it or the literary expression of that revolutionary movement.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p30\"></a>The <i>only point</i> upon which I am in complete agreement with Mr Proudhon is the disgust he feels for socialist sentimentalising. I anticipated him in provoking considerable hostility by the ridicule I directed at ovine, sentimental, utopian socialism. But is not Mr Proudhon subject to strange delusions when he opposes his petty-bourgeois sentimentality, by which I mean his homilies about home, conjugal love and suchlike banalities, to socialist sentimentality which \u2014 as for instance in Fourier\u2019s case \u2014 is infinitely more profound than the presumptuous platitudes of our worthy Proudhon?</p>", "<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p31\"></a>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"stea\"><b>***</b></span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"], "year": "1846", "sourceBook": "To Pavel Vasilyevich Annenkov", "author": "Marx", "title": "", "image": "marxy", "info": "Marx (1846): To Pavel Vasilyevich Annenkov", "idChr": "1.12text"}, {"content": ["<p class=\"noind\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p0\"></a>1) <i>ad</i> FEUERBACH</p>", "<p class=\"mid\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p1\"></a>1</p>", "<p><a id=\"p2\"></a>The chief defect of all previous materialism (that of Feuerbach included) is that things <i>[Gegenstand]</i>, reality, sensuousness are conceived only in the form of the <i>object</i>, <i>or of contemplation</i>, but not as <i>sensuous human activity</i>, <i>practice</i>, not subjectively.

The class which has the means of material production at its disposal, consequently also controls the means of mental production, so that the ideas of those who lack the means of mental production are on the whole subject to it. The ruling ideas are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relations, the dominant material relations grasped as ideas; hence of the relations which make the one class the ruling one, therefore, the ideas of its dominance. The individuals composing the ruling class possess among other things consciousness, and therefore think. Insofar, therefore, as they rule as a class and determine the extent and compass of an historical epoch, it is self-evident that they do this in its whole range, hence among other things rule also as thinkers, as producers of ideas, and regulate the production and distribution of the ideas of their age: thus their ideas are the ruling ideas of the epoch. For instance, in an age and in a country where royal power, aristocracy and bourgeoisie are contending for domination and where, therefore, domination is shared, the doctrine of the separation of powers proves to be the dominant idea and is expressed as an \u201ceternal law\u201d.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>The division of labour, which we already saw above (pp. [15-18]) as one of the chief forces of history up till now, manifests itself also in the ruling class as the division of mental and material labour, so that inside this class one part appears as the thinkers of the class (its active, conceptive ideologists, who make the formation of the illusions of the class about itself their chief source of livelihood), while the others\u2019 attitude to these ideas and illusions is more passive and receptive, because they are in reality the active members of this class and have less time to make up illusions and ideas about themselves. Within this class this cleavage can even develop into a certain opposition and hostility between the two parts, but whenever a practical collision occurs in which the class itself is endangered they automatically vanish, in which case there also vanishes the appearance of the ruling ideas being not the ideas of the ruling class and having a power distinct from the power of this class. The existence of revolutionary ideas in a particular period presupposes the existence of a revolutionary class; about the premises of the latter sufficient has already been said above (pp. [18-19, 22-23]).</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>If now in considering the course of history we detach the ideas of the ruling class from the ruling class itself and attribute to them an independent existence, if we confine ourselves to saying that these or those ideas were dominant at a given time, without bothering ourselves about the conditions of production and the producers of these ideas, if we thus ignore the individuals and world conditions which are the source of the ideas, then we can say, for instance, that during the time the aristocracy was dominant, the concepts honour, loyalty, etc., were dominant, during the dominance of the bourgeoisie the concepts freedom, equality, etc. The ruling class itself on the whole imagines this to be so. This conception of history, which is common to all historians, particularly since the eighteenth century, will necessarily come up against the phenomenon that ever more abstract ideas hold sway, i.e., ideas which increasingly take on the form of universality. For each new class which puts itself in the place of one ruling before it is compelled, merely in order to carry through its aim, to present its interest as the common interest of all the members of society, that is, expressed in ideal form: it has to give its ideas the form of universality, and present them as the only rational, universally valid ones. The class making a revolution comes forward from the very start, if only because it is opposed to a <i>class</i>, not as a class but as the representative of the whole of society, as the whole mass of society confronting the one ruling class. [[Marginal note by Marx:] (Universality corresponds to 1) the class versus the estate, 2) the competition, world intercourse, etc., 3) the great numerical strength of the ruling class, 4) the illusion of the <i>common</i> interests, in the beginning this illusion is true, 5) the delusion of the ideologists and the division of labour.)] It can do this because initially its interest really is as yet mostly connected with the common interest of all other non-ruling classes, because under the pressure of hitherto existing conditions its interest has not yet been able to develop as the particular interest of a particular class. Its victory, therefore, benefits also many individuals of other classes which are not winning a dominant position, but only insofar as it now enables these individuals to raise themselves into the ruling class. When the French bourgeoisie overthrew the rule of the aristocracy, it thereby made it possible for many proletarians to raise themselves above the proletariat, but only insofar as they became bourgeois. Every new class, therefore, achieves domination only on a broader basis than that of the class ruling previously; on the other hand the opposition of the non-ruling class to the new ruling class then develops all the more sharply and profoundly. Both these things determine the fact that the struggle to be waged against this new ruling class, in its turn, has as its aim a more decisive and more radical negation of the previous conditions of society than all previous classes which sought to rule could have.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>This whole appearance, that the rule of a certain class is only the rule of certain ideas, comes to a natural end, of course, as soon as class rule in general ceases to be the form in which society is organised, that is to say, as soon as it is no longer necessary to represent a particular interest as general or the \u201cgeneral interest\u201d as ruling.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>Once the ruling ideas have been separated from the ruling individuals and, above all, from the relations which result from a given stage of the mode of production, and in this way the conclusion has been reached that history is always under the sway of ideas, it is very easy to abstract from these various ideas \u201cthe Idea\u201d, the thought, etc., as the dominant force in history, and thus to consider all these separate ideas and concepts as \u201cforms of self-determination\u201d of the Concept developing in history. It follows then naturally, too, that all the relations of men can be derived from the concept of man, man as conceived, the essence of man, Man. This has been done by speculative philosophy. Hegel himself confesses at the end of the <i>Geschichtsphilosophie</i> that he \u201chas considered the progress of <i>the concept</i> only\u201d and has represented in history the \u201ctrue <i>theodicy\u201d</i> (p. 446). Now one can go back again to the producers of \u201cthe concept\u201d, to the theorists, ideologists and philosophers, and one comes then to the conclusion that the philosophers, the thinkers as such, have at all times been dominant in history: a conclusion, as we see, already expressed by Hegel.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>The whole trick of proving the hegemony of the spirit in history (hierarchy Stirner calls it) is thus confined to the following three attempts.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>No. 1. One must separate the ideas of those ruling for empirical reasons, under empirical conditions and as corporeal individuals, from these rulers, and thus recognise the rule of ideas or illusions in history.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>No. 2. One must bring an order into this rule of ideas, prove a mystical connection among the successive ruling ideas, which is managed by regarding them as \u201cforms of self-determination of the concept\u201d (this is possible because by virtue of their empirical basis these ideas are really connected with one another and because, conceived as <i>mere</i> ideas, they become self-distinctions, distinctions made by thought).</p>", "<p><a id=\"p10\"></a>No. 3. To remove the mystical appearance of this \u201cself-determining concept\u201d it is changed into a person \u2014 \u201cself-consciousness\u201d \u2014 or, to appear thoroughly materialistic, into a series of persons, who represent the \u201cconcept\u201d in history, into the \u201cthinkers\u201d, the \u201cphilosophers\u201d, the ideologists, who again are understood as the manufacturers of history, as the \u201ccouncil of guardians\u201d, as the rulers.

Each person would exchange the wages he individually received for commodities of the same value as his respective wages; and in no case could the gain of one man or one trade be a loss to another man or another trade.

Proudhon, except that Mr. Bray, far from claiming the last word on behalf of humanity, proposes merely measures which he thinks good for a period of transition between existing society and a community regime.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p17\"></a>One hour of Peter\u2019s labour exchanges for one hour of Paul\u2019s labour. That is Mr. Bray\u2019s fundamental axiom.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p18\"></a>Let us suppose Peter has twelve hours\u2019 labour before him, and Paul only six. Peter will be able to make with Paul an exchange of only six for six. Peter will consequently have six hours\u2019 labour left over. What will he do with these six hours\u2019 labour?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p19\"></a>Either he will do nothing \u2014 in which case he will have worked six hours for nothing; or else he will remain idle for another six hours to get even; or else, as a last resource, he will give these six hours\u2019 labour, which he has no use for, to Paul into the bargain.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p20\"></a>What in the end will Peter have earned more than Paul? Some hours of labour? No! He will have gained only hours of leisure; he will be forced to play the loafer for six hours. And in order that this new right to loaf might be not only relished but sought after in the new society, this society would have to find in idleness its highest bliss, and to look upon labour as a heavy shackle from which it must break free at all costs. And again, to return to our example, if only these hours of leisure that Peter has gained in excess of Paul were really a gain! Not in the least. Paul, beginning by working only six hours, attains by steady and regular work a result that Peter secures only by beginning with an excess of work. Everyone will want to be Paul, there will be a competition to occupy Paul\u2019s position, a competition in idleness.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p21\"></a>Well, then! What has the exchange of equal quantities of labour brought us? Overproduction, depreciation, excess of labour followed by unemployment; in short, economic relations such as we see in present-day society, minus the competition of labour.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p22\"></a>No! We are wrong! There is still an expedient which may save this new society, the society of Peters and Pauls. Peter will consume by himself the product of the six hours\u2019 labour which he has left. But since he has no longer to exchange in order to have produced, he has no need to produce in order to exchange; and the whole hypothesis of a society founded on the exchange and division of labour will fall to the ground. Equality of exchange will have been saved by the simple fact that exchange will have ceased to be: Paul and Peter will arrive at the position of Robinson.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p23\"></a>Thus, if all the members of society are supposed to be immediate workers, the exchange of equal quantities of hours of labour is possible only on condition that the number of hours to be spent on material production is agreed on beforehand. But such an agreement negates individual exchange.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p24\"></a>We still come to the same result, if we take as our starting point not the distribution of the products created but the act of production. In large-scale industry, Peter is not free to fix for himself the time of his labour, for Peter\u2019s labour is nothing without the co-operation of all the Peters and all the Pauls who make up the workshop. This explains very well the dogged resistance which the English factory owners put up to the <i>Ten Hours Bill</i>. They knew only too well that a two hours\u2019 reduction of labour granted to women and children would carry with it an equal reduction of working hours for adult men. It is in the nature of large-scale industry that working hours should be equal for all. What is today the result of capital and the competition of workers among themselves will be tomorrow, if you sever the relation between labour and capital, an actual agreement based upon the relation between the sum of productive forces and the sum of existing needs.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p25\"></a>But such an agreement is a condemnation of individual exchange, and we are back again at our first conclusion!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p26\"></a>In principle, there is no exchange of products \u2014 but there is the exchange of the labour which co-operates in production. The mode of exchange of products depends upon the mode of exchange of the productive forces. In general, the form of exchange of products corresponds to the form of production. Change the latter, and the former will change in consequence. Thus in the history of society we see that the mode of exchanging products is regulated by the mode of producing them. Individual exchange corresponds also to a definite mode of production which itself corresponds to class antagonism. There is thus no individual exchange without the antagonism of classes.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p27\"></a>But the honest conscience refuses to see this obvious fact. So long as one is a bourgeois, one cannot but see in this relation of antagonism a relation of harmony and eternal justice, which allows no one to gain at the expense of another. For the bourgeois, individual exchange can exist without any antagonism of classes. For him, these are two quite unconnected things. Individual exchange, as the bourgeois conceives it, is far from resembling individual exchange as it is practised.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p28\"></a>Mr. Bray turns the <i>illusion</i> of the respectable bourgeois into an ideal he would like to attain. In a purified individual exchange, freed from all the elements of antagonism he finds in it, he sees an <i>\u201cequalitarian\u201d</i> relation which he would like society to adopt.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p29\"></a>Mr. Bray does not see that this equalitarian relation, this corrective ideal that he would like to apply to the world, is itself nothing but the reflection of the actual world; and that therefore it is totally impossible to reconstitute society on the basis of what is merely an embellished shadow of it. In proportion as this shadow takes on substance again, we perceive that this substance, far from being the transfiguration dreamt of, is the actual body of existing society. [Mr. Bray\u2019s theory, like all theories, has found supporters who have allowed themselves to be deluded by appearances. <i>Equitable-labour-exchange bazaars</i> have been set up in London, Sheffield, Leeds and many other towns in England. These bazaars have all ended in scandalous failures after having absorbed considerable capital. The taste for them has gone for ever. You are warned, M. Proudhon! <i>[Note by Marx</i>.

We may go even further: wages are the proportion of the elements composing wealth and consumed reproductively every day by the mass of the workers. Now, to double wages... is to attribute to each one of the producers a greater share than his product, which is contradictory, and if the rise extends only to a small number of industries, it brings about a general disturbance in exchange; in a word, a <i>dearth</i>...

In the opposite case, in which the price of their goods is not lowered, their profit will rise above the general rate of profits. Machines are not wage-earners. Therefore, the general rise in wages will affect less those industries, which, compared with the others, employ more machines than workers. But as competition always tends to level the rate of profits, those profits which rise above the general rate cannot but be transitory. Thus, apart from a few fluctuations, a general rise in wages will lead, not as M.

Thus combination always has a double aim, that of stopping competition among the workers, so that they can carry on general competition with the capitalist. If the first aim of resistance was merely the maintenance of wages, combinations, at first isolated, constitute themselves into groups as the capitalists in their turn unite for the purpose of repression, and in face of always united capital, the maintenance of the association becomes more necessary to them than that of wages. This is so true that English economists are amazed to see the workers sacrifice a good part of their wages in favour of associations, which, in the eyes of these economists, are established solely in favour of wages.

He has consumed it, and since it did not exist as a thing but as a capacity in a living being, he can renew the exchange in view of the <i>specific</i> nature of his commodity \u2014 the specific nature of the life process.

If capital had to work in order to live, it would not preserve itself as capital but as labour. The ownership of raw materials and the instruments of labour would be purely <i>nominal;</i> economically, they would belong just as much to the worker as to the capitalist, since they would produce <i>value</i> for the capitalist only in so far as he was himself a worker. He would therefore not treat them as capital but as mere physical matter and means of labour, just as the worker himself does in the process of production.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>If, on the contrary, e.g. only half a working day is needed to keep a worker alive for a whole working day, a surplus value of the product is the automatic result, because the capitalist has paid in the price [of labour] only half a working day and he has received a whole working day objectified in the product; therefore has exchanged <i>nothing</i> for the second half of the working day. It is not exchange but a process in which he obtains without exchange <i>objectified labour time</i>, i.e. <i>value</i>, which alone can make him into a capitalist. Half the working day costs capital <i>nothing;</i> it therefore receives a value for which it has given no equivalent. And the augmentation of values can occur only because a value over and above the equivalent is obtained, hence <i>created</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>Speaking generally, surplus value is value over and above the equivalent. The equivalent, by definition, is only the identity of value with itself. Surplus value can never, therefore, spring from the equivalent; nor, therefore, can it spring originally from circulation. It must spring from the process of production of capital itself. The matter can also be expressed thus: if the worker requires only half a working day to live for a whole day, he needs to work only half a day to eke out his existence as a worker. The second half of the working day is forced labour; surplus labour. What appears on the side of capital as surplus value, appears on the worker\u2019s side precisely as surplus labour over and above his requirements as worker, hence over and above his immediate requirements to sustain his vitality.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>The great historical aspect of capital is the <i>creation</i> of this <i>surplus labour</i>, superfluous from the point of view of mere use value, of mere subsistence, and its historical mission is fulfilled when, on the one hand, needs are developed to the point where surplus labour beyond what is necessary has itself become a general need and arises from the individual needs themselves; and on the other, when, by the strict discipline of capital to which successive generations have been subjected, general industriousness has been developed as the universal asset of the new generation; and, lastly, when the productive forces of labour, constantly whipped on by capital in its unbounded lust for enrichment, and in the conditions in which alone it can satisfy this lust, have been developed to the stage where the possession and preservation of general wealth requires from the whole of society only comparatively little labour time on the one hand, and on the other labouring society takes a scientific attitude towards the process of its continuing reproduction, its reproduction in ever greater abundance; so that labour in which man does what he can make things do for him has ceased.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>Accordingly, capital and labour relate to each other here like money and commodity: if the one is the general form of wealth, the other is merely the substance seeking immediate consumption. As the ceaseless striving for the general form of wealth, however, capital forces labour beyond the limits of natural need and thus creates the material elements for the development of the rich individuality, which is as varied and comprehensive in its production as it is in its consumption, and whose labour therefore no longer appears as labour but as the full development of activity itself, in which natural necessity has disappeared in its immediate form; because natural need has been replaced by historically produced need. This is why <i>capital is productive</i>, i.e. an <i>essential relationship for the development of the productive forces of society</i>.

His analysis is altogether wrong and childish, because</p>", "<p><a id=\"p2\"></a>(1) he considers <i>overpopulation as of the same kind</i> in different historical phases of economic development, does not understand its specific differences and hence stupidly reduces those very complicated and changing relations to one relation, in which on the one hand the natural propagation of mankind, on the other the natural propagation of edible plants (or <span class=\"eng\">means of subsistence</span>) confront each other as two natural series, the one geometric and the other arithmetic in progression. In this way, he transforms historically distinct relations into an abstract numerical relation which he simply plucks out of thin air, and which is based on neither natural nor historical laws. There is supposed to be a natural difference between the propagation of men and that of e.g. grain. The monkey here assumes that the <i>increase of mankind</i> is a purely natural process, which requires <i>external <span class=\"eng\">restraints</span></i>, <i><span class=\"eng\">checks</span></i>, if it is not to proceed geometrically.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>The <i>geometrical propagation</i> is [supposed to be] the natural process of human propagation. In history, he can find that population develops under widely different conditions and that overpopulation is, likewise, an historically determined relationship, and not at all determined by numbers, or by any absolute limit to the production of means of subsistence. It is always determined by limits posited by <i>particular conditions of production</i>. Limited with respect to numbers. How small do the numbers now seem to us which signified overpopulation to the Athenians! Secondly, limited with respect to character. An overpopulation of free Athenians who are transformed into colonists differs significantly from an overpopulation of workers who are transformed into <span class=\"eng\">inmates of workhouses</span>. Similarly, the mendicant overpopulation, which consumes the surplus produce of a monastery, differs significantly from that which develops in a <span class=\"eng\">factory</span>. It is Malthus who abstracts from these specific historical laws of population movements, which make up the history of the nature of man, his <i>natural</i> laws. But they are the natural laws of man only at a certain level of historical development, corresponding to a certain level of development of the productive forces which is determined by his own historical process.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>Malthusian man, abstracted from historically determined man, exists only in Malthus\u2019s brain; hence also the geometrical method of propagation corresponding to this natural Malthusian man. Actual history therefore appears to him in such a light that he does not conceive the propagation of his natural man as an abstraction from the historical process, from actual propagation, but, on the contrary, he conceives actual propagation as an application of the Malthusian theory. Therefore, what constitutes in history, at every stage, the immanent conditions of both population and overpopulation, appears with him as a series of <i>external <span class=\"eng\">checks</span></i>, which have <i>prevented</i> population from growing in the Malthusian way. The conditions in which men historically produce and reproduce themselves, appear as <i>barriers</i> on the reproduction of Malthusian natural man, who is a pure Malthusian creation. On the other side, the production of the means of subsistence, as it is <span class=\"eng\">\u201cchecked\u201d</span>, i.e. determined by the action of men, appears as a <span class=\"eng\">check</span> imposed by that production itself. Ferns once covered the whole earth. Their reproduction ceased only when there was no more room for any more. It did not conform to any arithmetical proportion. It is difficult to say where Malthus discovered that the reproduction of spontaneously propagating natural products comes to a halt in response to an inner urge, without <i>external <span class=\"eng\">checks</span></i>. He transforms the immanent, historically changing limits on the process of man\u2019s propagation into <i>external barriers;</i> and the <i>external <span class=\"eng\">checks</span></i> acting on natural reproduction into <i>immanent limits</i> or <i>natural laws</i> of propagation.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>(2) He foolishly relates a certain number of men to a certain quantity of means of subsistence. Ricardo straight away countered this by correctly pointing out that the quantity of available grain is quite immaterial for the worker if he is without <i>employment;</i> that it is therefore the <span class=\"eng\">means of employment</span> and not <span class=\"eng\">of subsistence</span> which determine whether or not he belongs in the category of surplus population.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>But this applies more widely, and is true in general of the <i>social mediation</i> by which the individual relates to the means of his reproduction and produces them. Hence it is true of the <i>conditions of production</i> and his relation to them. For the slave in Athens, the only barrier to his multiplication was the quantity of <span class=\"eng\">necessaries</span> which could be produced. And we never hear that there was a <i>surplus of slaves</i> in antiquity. On the contrary, the demand for them rose. Yet there was certainly a surplus population of non-workers (in the direct sense), who were not too many with respect to the available means of subsistence, but who had lost the conditions enabling them to appropriate. The invention of surplus workers, i.e. of propertyless men who work, belongs to the epoch of capital.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>The beggars who attached themselves to the monasteries, and helped them to consume their surplus product, belong to the same class as the <span class=\"eng\">retainers</span> of the feudal lords, and this shows that the surplus <span class=\"eng\">produce</span> could not be entirely consumed by the small number of its owners. This is only another form of the <span class=\"eng\">retainers of old</span>, or the <span class=\"eng\">menial servants of today</span>. Overpopulation among e.g. the <span class=\"eng\">hunting peoples</span>, which is manifested in the struggle between individual tribes, does not prove that the soil could not support the small number of people who lived on it, but rather that the conditions of their reproduction necessitated a large territory to feed a few mouths.

The last form of servility assumed by human activity, that of wage labour on the one hand and of capital on the other, is thereby shed, and this shedding is itself the result of the mode of production corresponding to capital.

In the second, the changed mode of distribution would set out from a <i>changed</i>, new basis of production, one which has arisen solely as a result of the historical process.</p>"], "year": "1857\u20141858", "sourceBook": "Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy", "author": "Marx", "title": "J.

Having shown that the periodical resistance on the part of the working men against a reduction of wages, and their periodical attempts at getting a rise of wages, are inseparable from the wages system, and dictated by the very fact of labour being assimilated to commodities, and therefore subject to the laws regulating the general movement of prices; having, furthermore, shown that a general rise of wages would result in a fall in the general rate of profit, but not affect the average prices of commodities, or their values, the question now ultimately arises, how far, in this incessant struggle between capital and labour, the latter is likely to prove successful.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p1\"></a>I might answer by a generalisation, and say that, as with all other commodities, so with labour, its <i>market price</i> will, in the long run, adapt itself to its <i>value;</i> that, therefore, despite all the ups and downs, and do what he may, the working man will, on an average, only receive the value of his labour, which resolves into the value of his labouring power, which is determined by the value of the necessaries required for its maintenance and reproduction, which value of necessaries finally is regulated by the quantity of labour wanted to produce them.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p2\"></a>But there are some peculiar features which distinguish the <i>value of the labouring power</i>, or <i>the value of labour</i>, from the values of all other commodities. The value of the labouring power is formed by two elements \u2014 the one merely physical, the other historical or social. Its <i>ultimate limit</i> is determined by the <i>physical</i> element, that is to say, to maintain and reproduce itself, to perpetuate its physical existence, the working class must receive the necessaries absolutely indispensable for living and multiplying. The <i>value</i> of those indispensable necessaries forms, therefore, the ultimate limit of the <i>value of labour</i>. On the other hand, the length of the working day is also limited by ultimate, although very elastic boundaries. Its ultimate limit is given by the physical force of the labouring man. If the daily exhaustion of his vital forces exceeds a certain degree, it cannot be exerted anew, day by day. However, as I said, this limit is very elastic. A quick succession of unhealthy and short-lived generations will keep the labour market as well supplied as a series of vigorous and long-lived generations.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>Besides this mere physical element, the value of labour is in every country determined by a <i>traditional standard of life</i>. It is not mere physical life, but it is the satisfaction of certain wants springing from the social conditions in which people are placed and reared up. The English standard of life may be reduced to the Irish standard; the standard of life of a German peasant to that of a Livonian peasant. The important part which historical tradition and social habitude play in this respect, you may learn from Mr. Thornton\u2019s work on <i>Over-population</i>, where he shows that the average wages in different agricultural districts of England still nowadays differ more or less according to the more or less favourable circumstances under which the districts have emerged from the state of serfdom.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>This historical or social element, entering into the value of labour, may be expanded, or contracted, or altogether extinguished, so that nothing remains but the <i>physical limit</i>. During the time of the <i>anti-Jacobin war</i>, undertaken, as the incorrigible tax-eater and sinecurist, old George Rose, used to say, to save the comforts of our holy religion from the inroads of the French infidels, the honest English farmers, so tenderly handled in a former chapter of ours, depressed the wages of the agricultural labourers even beneath that <i>mere physical minimum</i>, but made up by <i>Poor Laws</i> [\r\n\r\n] the remainder necessary for the physical perpetuation of the race. This was a glorious way to convert the wages labourer into a slave, and Shakespeare\u2019s proud yeoman into a pauper.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>By comparing the standard wages or values of labour in different countries, and by comparing them in different historical epochs of the same country, you will find that the <i>value of labour</i> itself is not a fixed but a variable magnitude, even supposing the values of all other commodities to remain constant.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>A similar comparison would prove that not only the <i>market rates of profit</i> change but its <i>average rates</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>But as to <i>profits</i>, there exists no law which determines their <i>minimum</i>. We cannot say what is the ultimate limit of their decrease. And why cannot we fix that limit? Because, although we can fix the <i>minimum</i> of wages, we cannot fix their <i>maximum</i>. We can only say that, the limits of the working day being given, the <i>maximum of profit</i> corresponds to the <i>physical minimum of wages;</i> and that wages being given, the <i>maximum of profit</i> corresponds to such a prolongation of the working day as is compatible with the physical forces of the labourer. The maximum of profit is, therefore, limited by the physical minimum of wages and the physical maximum of the working day. It is evident that between the two limits of this <i>maximum rate of profit</i> an immense scale of variations is possible. The fixation of its actual degree is only settled by the continuous struggle between capital and labour, the capitalist constantly tending to reduce wages to their physical minimum, and to extend the working day to its physical maximum, while the working man constantly presses in the opposite direction.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>The matter resolves itself into a question of the respective powers of the combatants.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>2. As to the <i>limitation of the working day</i> in England, as in all other countries, it has never been settled except by legislative interference. Without the working men\u2019s continuous pressure from without that interference would never have taken place. But at all events, the result was not to be attained by private settlement between the working men and the capitalists. This very necessity of <i>general political action</i> affords the proof that in its merely economic action capital is the stronger side.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p10\"></a>As to the <i>limits</i> of the <i>value of labour</i>, its actual settlement always depends upon supply and demand. I mean the demand for labour on the part of capital, and the supply of labour by the working men. In colonial countries the law of supply and demand favours the working man. Hence the relatively high standard of wages in the United States. Capital may there try its utmost. It cannot prevent the labour market from being continuously emptied by the continuous conversion of wages labourers into independent, self-sustaining peasants. The position of a wages labourer is for a very large part of the American people but a probational state, which they are sure to leave within a longer or shorter term. To mend this colonial state of things, the paternal British Government accepted for some time what is called the modern colonisation theory, which consists in putting an artificial high price upon colonial land, in order to prevent the too quick conversion of the wages labourer into the independent peasant. [102]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p11\"></a>But let us now come to old civilised countries, in which capital domineers over the whole process of production. Take, for example, the rise in England of agricultural wages from 1849 to 1859. What was its consequence? The farmers could not, as our friend Weston would have advised them, raise the value of wheat, nor even its market prices. They had, on the contrary, to submit to their fall. But during these eleven years they introduced machinery of all sorts, adopted more scientific methods, converted part of arable land into pasture, increased the size of farms, and with this the scale of production, and by these and other processes, diminishing the demand for labour by increasing its productive power, made the agricultural population again relatively redundant. This is the general method in which a reaction, quicker or slower, of capital against a rise of wages takes place in old, settled countries. Ricardo has justly remarked that machinery is in constant competition with labour, and can often be only introduced when the price of labour has reached a certain height, but the appliance of machinery is but one of the many methods for increasing the productive powers of labour. [D. Ricardo, <i>On the Principles of Political Economy, and Taxation</i>, London, 1821, p. 479.] This very same development which makes common labour relatively redundant simplifies on the other hand skilled labour, and thus depreciates it.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p12\"></a>The same law obtains in another form. With the development of the productive powers of labour the accumulation of capital will be accelerated, even despite a relatively high rate of wages. Hence, one might infer, as <i>Adam Smith</i>, in whose days modern industry was still in its infancy, did infer, that the accelerated accumulation of capital must turn the balance in favour of the working man, by securing a growing demand for his labour. From this same standpoint many contemporary writers have wondered that English capital having grown in the last twenty years so much quicker than English population, wages should not have been more enhanced. But simultaneously with the progress of accumulation there takes place a <i>progressive change</i> in the <i>composition of capital</i>. That part of the aggregate capital which consists of fixed capital, machinery, raw materials, means of production in all possible forms, progressively increases as compared with the other part of capital, which is laid out in wages or in the purchase of labour. This law has been stated in a more or less accurate manner by Mr. Barton, Ricardo, Sismondi, Professor Richard Jones, Professor Ramsay, Cherbuliez, and others.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p13\"></a>If the proportion of these two elements of capital was originally one to one, it will, in the progress of industry, become five to one, and so forth. If of a total capital of 600, 300 is laid out in instruments, raw materials, and so forth, and 300 in wages, the total capital wants only to be doubled to create a demand for 600 working men instead of for 300. But if of a capital of 600, 500 is laid out in machinery, materials, and so forth, and 100 only in wages, the same capital must increase from 600 to 3,600 in order to create a demand for 600 workmen instead of 300. In the progress of industry the demand for labour keeps, therefore, no pace with accumulation of capital. It will still increase, but increase in a constantly diminishing ratio as compared with the increase of capital.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p14\"></a>These few hints will suffice to show that the very development of modern industry must progressively turn the scale in favour of the capitalist against the working man, and that consequently the general tendency of capitalistic production is not to raise, but to sink the average standard of wages, or to push the <i>value of labour</i> more or less to its <i>minimum limit</i>. Such being the tendency of <i>things</i> in this system, is this saying that the working class ought to renounce their resistance against the encroachments of capital, and abandon their attempts at making the best of the occasional chances for their temporary improvement? If they did, they would be degraded to one level mass of broken wretches past salvation. I think I have shown that their struggles for the standard of wages are incidents inseparable from the whole wages system, that in 99 cases out of 100 their efforts at raising wages are only efforts at maintaining the given value of labour, and that the necessity of debating their price with the capitalist is inherent in their condition of having to sell themselves as commodities. By cowardly giving way in their everyday conflict with capital, they would certainly disqualify themselves for the initiating of any larger movement.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p15\"></a>At the same time, and quite apart from the general servitude involved in the wages system, the working class ought not to exaggerate to themselves the ultimate working of these everyday struggles. They ought not to forget that they are fighting with effects, but not with the causes of those effects; that they are retarding the downward movement, but not changing its direction; that they are applying palliatives, not curing the malady. They ought, therefore, not to be exclusively absorbed in these unavoidable guerilla fights incessantly springing up from the never-ceasing encroachments of capital or changes of the market. They ought to understand that, with all the miseries it imposes upon them, the present system simultaneously engenders the <i>material conditions</i> and the <i>social forms</i> necessary for an economical reconstruction of society. Instead of the <i>conservative</i> motto, <i>\u201cA fair day\u2019s wage for a fair day\u2019s work!\u201d</i> they ought to inscribe on their banner the <i>revolutionary</i> watchword, <i>\u201cAbolition of the wages system!\u201d</i></p>", "<p><a id=\"p16\"></a>After this very long and, I fear, tedious exposition which I was obliged to enter into to do some justice to the subject-matter, I shall conclude by proposing the following resolutions:</p>", "<p><a id=\"p17\"></a>Firstly. A general rise in the rate of wages would result in a fall of the general rate of profit, but, broadly speaking, not affect the prices of commodities.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p18\"></a>Secondly. The general tendency of capitalist production is not to raise, but to sink the average standard of wages.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p19\"></a>Thirdly. Trades Unions work well as centres of resistance against the encroachments of capital. They fail partially from an injudicious use of their power. They fail generally from limiting themselves to a guerilla war against the effects of the existing system, instead of simultaneously trying to change it, instead of using their organised forces as a lever for the final emancipation of the working class, that is to say, the ultimate abolition of the wages system.</p>"], "year": "1865", "sourceBook": "Value, Price and Profit", "author": "Marx", "title": "", "image": "marx", "info": "Marx (1865): Value, Price and Profit", "idChr": "2.06text"}, {"content": ["<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p0\"></a>Alienated Labour</h6>", "<p><a id=\"p1\"></a>Even from the point of view of the merely <i>formal</i> relation \u2014 the <i>general</i> form of capitalist production, which has its less developed mode in common with the more developed \u2014 the <i>means of production</i>, the <i>objective conditions of labour</i>, do not appear as subsumed under the worker; rather, he appears as subsumed under them. <span class=\"eng\">Capital employs labour</span>.

As such social forces they are <i>\u201ccapitalised\u201d</i> vis-\u00e0-vis labour. In fact, communal unity in cooperation, combination in the division of labour, the application of the forces of nature and science, as well as the products of labour in the shape of machinery, are all things which confront the individual workers as <i>alien</i>, <i>objective</i>, <i>and present in advance</i>, without their assistance, and often against them, independent of them, as mere forms of existence of the means of labour which are independent of them and <i>rule over</i> them, in so far as they are <i>objective;</i> while the intelligence and volition of the total workshop, incarnated in the capitalist or his <span class=\"eng\">understrappers</span> (representatives), in so far as the workshop is formed by the combination of the means of labour, confront the workers as <i>functions</i> of capital, which lives in the person of the capitalist. The social forms of their own labour \u2014 the subjective as well as the objective forms \u2014 or the form of their own social labour, are relations constituted quite independently of the individual workers; the workers as subsumed under capital become elements of these social constructions, but these social constructions do not belong to them. They therefore confront the workers as <i>shapes</i> of capital itself, as combinations which, unlike their isolated labour capacities, belong to capital, originate from it and are incorporated within it. And this assumes a form which is the more real the more, on the one hand, their labour capacity is itself modified by these forms, so that it becomes powerless when it stands alone, i.e. <i>outside</i> this context of capitalism, and its capacity for independent production is destroyed, while on the other hand the development of machinery causes the conditions of labour to appear as ruling labour technologically too, and at the same time to replace it, suppress it, and render it superfluous in its independent forms. In this process, in which the <i>social</i> characteristics of their labour confront them as <i>capitalised</i>, to a certain extent \u2014 in the way that e.g. in machinery the visible products of labour appear as ruling over labour \u2014 the same thing of course takes place for the forces of nature and science, the product of general historical development in its abstract quintessence: they confront the workers as <i>powers</i> of capital. They become in fact separated from the skill and knowledge of the individual worker, and although \u2014 if we look at them from the point of view of their source \u2014 they are in turn the product of labour, they appear as <i>incorporated</i> into capital wherever they enter the labour process. The capitalist who employs a machine does not need to understand it (see Ure). But vis-\u00e0-vis the workers, realised science appears in the machine as capital. And in fact all these applications of science, of the forces of nature and of large masses of products of labour \u2014 applications based on <i>social labour</i> \u2014 appear only as <i>means of exploitation</i> of labour, means of appropriating surplus labour, hence, vis-\u00e0-vis labour, as <i>forces</i> belonging to capital. Capital naturally employs all these means only to exploit labour, but in order to exploit labour, it must employ them in production. And thus the development of the <i>social</i> productive powers of labour and the conditions for this development appear as the <i>work of capital</i>, and not only does the individual worker relate passively to this work, it also takes place in antagonism to him.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>Capital itself is dual, since it consists of commodities.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a><i>Exchange value</i> (money), but self-<i>valorising value</i>, value which creates value, <i>grows as value</i>, obtains an increment, through the fact that it is <i>value</i>. This can be reduced to the exchange of a given quantity of objectified labour for a greater quantity of living labour.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a><i>Use value</i>, and here capital appears according to its particular situation in the labour process. But precisely here it does not just remain material of labour, means of labour to which <i>labour</i> belongs, and which have incorporated labour, but involves also, along with labour, its <i>social combinations</i> and the development of the means of labour which corresponds to these social combinations. Capitalist production first develops the conditions of the labour process on a large scale \u2014 first develops them separately from the single independent worker \u2014 developing both its objective and its subjective conditions, but developing them as powers which dominate the <i>individual worker</i> and are <i>alien</i> to him.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>Thus capital becomes a very mysterious being.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>The conditions of labour are heaped up vis-\u00e0-vis the worker as <i>social powers</i>, and in this form <i>they become capitalised</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>Capital is therefore <i>productive:</i></p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>1) as the <i>compulsion to do surplus labour</i>.

The way in which the law of capitalist production \u2014 the creation of surplus value, etc. \u2014 enforces this has already been discussed. It appears as inflicted by the capitalists upon each other and upon the workers \u2014 hence it in fact appears as a law of capital operating against both capital and labour. The natural social powers of labour do not develop in the <i>valorisation process</i> as such but in the <i>real labour process</i>. They therefore appear as properties which belong to capital as a thing, they appear as its use value. Productive labour \u2014 as value producing \u2014 always confronts capital as the labour of <i>isolated</i> workers, whatever social combinations those workers may enter into in the production process. Thus whereas capital represents the social productive power of labour towards the workers, productive labour always represents towards capital only the labour of the <i>isolated</i> workers.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p11\"></a>We saw in dealing with the <i>accumulation process</i> how past labour, in the form of the forces and conditions of production that have already been produced, raises reproduction, in terms of both use value and exchange value \u2014 both the amount of value a particular quantity of living labour <i>preserves</i>, and the <i>quantity of use values</i> it produces anew \u2014 and how the moment through which it does this appears as a <i>force immanent in capital</i>, because <i>objectified labour</i> always functions vis-\u00e0-vis the worker in capitalised form.</p>"], "year": "1863\u20141867", "sourceBook": "Results of the Direct Production Process", "author": "Marx", "title": "Alienated Labour", "image": "marx", "info": "Marx (1863\u20141867): Results of the Direct Production Process", "idChr": "2.07.02text"}, {"content": ["<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p0\"></a>The Reproduction of the Capitalist Relationship</h6>", "<p><a id=\"p1\"></a>Initially, the sum of money or of value advanced is only capital \u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03b9 [potentially], only capital <i>in itself</i>, even after it has been converted into the factors of the labour process \u2014 means of production, <i>constant</i> capital \u2014 and into <i>labour capacity</i>, into which the variable capital has been converted. This <i>mere</i> potentiality was even more the case before its conversion into the factors of the real production process. Only within the latter, through the <i>real</i> incorporation of living labour into the objective forms of existence of capital, only through the real absorption of additional labour, is <i>this labour</i> converted into capital; and not only this labour is converted, but the sum of value advanced is converted from possible capital, value earmarked as capital, into effective and actual capital. What took place during the process as a whole? The worker sold the right to dispose of his labour capacity in order to secure the necessary means of subsistence, for a given value, determined by the value of his labour capacity. What, therefore, is the result from his point of view? <i>Simplement</i> and <i>purement</i> [simply and purely] the reproduction of his labour capacity. So what did he give away? He gave value-preserving, value-creating and value-increasing activity, his labour. He therefore comes out of the process as he entered it, if we leave aside the wearing down of his labour power. He emerges as merely subjective labour power, which must pass through the same process again, in order to preserve itself.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p2\"></a>Capital, in contrast, does not come out of the process as it entered it. It is <i>in</i> the process that it is first converted into actual capital, into self-valorising value. The total product is now the form in which capital exists as realised capital, and as such it again confronts labour as the property of the capitalist, as a power which is independent and has been created by labour itself. Hence the production process was not only its reproduction process, but its process of production as capital. Previously the conditions of production confronted the worker as capital in so far as he <i>found</i> them <i>to be present</i> over against him <i>in independence</i>. Now it is the product of his own labour that he finds confronting him as conditions of production that have been converted into <i>capital</i>. What started as a presupposition is now the result of the production process.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>Saying that the production process creates <i>capital</i> is only another way of saying that it has created <i>surplus value</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>But the matter does not rest here. The <i>surplus value</i> is reconverted into additional capital, is manifested in the formation of new capital or capital of greater size. Thus <i>capital</i> has created <i>capital;</i> it has not just realised itself as capital. The <i>accumulation process</i> is itself an immanent moment of the capitalist production process. It includes the <i>creation</i> of new <i>wage labourers</i>, who are means to the realisation and augmentation of the existing capital, whether because sections of the population not previously seized on by capitalist production, such as women and children, are now subsumed under it, or because a greater number of workers, resulting from the natural increase of the <span class=\"eng\">population</span>, are subjected to it. It emerges from a closer examination that capital itself <i>regulates</i> this production of labour power, the production of the mass of human beings it intends to exploit, in accordance with its requirements for this exploitation. Capital therefore does not just produce capital, it produces a growing mass of workers, the material which alone enables it to function as additional capital. Hence not only does labour produce the conditions of labour on an ever increasing scale as <i>capital</i>, in opposition to itself; capital, for its part, produces on an ever increasing scale the <i>productive wage labourers</i> it requires. Labour produces its conditions of production as capital, and capital produces labour as the means of its realisation as capital, as wage labour. Capitalist production is not only the reproduction of the relation, it is its reproduction on an ever growing scale; and in the same proportion as the social productive power of labour develops, along with the capitalist mode of production, the pile of wealth confronting the worker grows, as <i>wealth ruling over</i> him, as <i>capital</i>, and the world of wealth expands vis-\u00e0-vis the worker as an alien and dominating world. At the opposite pole, and in the same proportion, the worker\u2019s subjective poverty, neediness and dependency develop. The <i>deprivation</i> of the worker and the <i>abundance</i> of capital correspond with each other, they keep in step. At the same time the numbers of the working <i>proletariat</i>, these living means for the production of capital, increase.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>The <i>growth of capital</i> and the <i>increase of the proletariat</i> therefore appear as associated <i>products</i> of the same process, even if they are polar opposites.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>The relation is not only reproduced, not only produced on an ever more massive scale, it not only creates more workers for itself and constantly seizes upon branches of production previously not subjected to it, it is also reproduced under circumstances which are more and more favourable to one side, the capitalists, and more and more unfavourable to the other, the wage labourers. This was demonstrated in our presentation of the specifically capitalist mode of production.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>From the point of view of the continuity of the production process, the wage is only the <i>part</i> of the product constantly produced by the worker which is converted into means of subsistence for him, and therefore into the means of preserving and increasing the labour capacities capital requires for its own self-valorisation, for its vital process. This preservation and increase of labour capacities, as the result of the process, therefore itself appears as nothing but the reproduction and extension of capital\u2019s own conditions of reproduction and accumulation. (See the Yankee.)</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>With this there also disappears the <i>superficial appearance</i> the relation originally possessed, that <i>commodity owners</i> with equal rights met each other in circulation, on the commodity market, distinguished from each other, like all other <i>commodity owners</i>, only by the material content of their commodities, the particular use value of the commodities they had to sell to each other. Or, this <i>original</i> form of the relation only remains behind as the <i>superficial appearance</i> of the <i>capitalist</i> relation that underlies it.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>Two aspects need to be distinguished here, through which the <i>reproduction of the relation itself</i> on an ever increasing scale as a result of the capitalist production process is distinguished from the first form, as it on the one hand emerges <i>historically</i> and on the other hand constantly presents itself anew on the surface of developed capitalist society.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p10\"></a>1) <span class=\"spt\">Firstly</span>, <i>with regard to the initial process</i> which occurs within circulation, the <i>sale and purchase of labour capacity</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p11\"></a>The capitalist production process is not only the <i>conversion</i> into <i>capital</i> of the value or the commodities the capitalist in part brings to market and in part retains for himself within the labour process; these products <i>converted</i> into capital are not <i>the capitalist\u2019s</i> products, they are the worker\u2019s. The former repeatedly sells the latter a part of his product \u2014 the necessary means of subsistence \u2014 for labour, in order to preserve and increase labour capacity, the <i>buyer</i> himself, and he repeatedly lends him another part of his product, the objective conditions of labour, as a means for the self-valorisation of capital, as <i>capital</i>. While the worker thus reproduces his products as <i>capital</i>, the capitalist reproduces the worker as a <i>wage labourer</i>, and therefore as a seller of his own labour. The relation between mere commodity sellers implies that they exchange <i>their</i> own <i>labour</i>, as incorporated in different use values. The sale and purchase of labour capacity, as the constant <i>result</i> of the capitalist production process, implies that the worker must constantly <i>buy back</i> a part of his own product by selling his living labour. With this, the <i>superficial appearance</i> of a simple relation between commodity owners <i>fades away</i>. This constant sale and purchase of labour capacity, and the constant confrontation between the worker and the commodity produced by the worker himself, as <i>buyer</i> of his labour capacity and as constant capital, appears only as the <i>form mediating</i> his subjugation to capital, the subjugation of living labour as a mere means to the preservation and increase of the <i>objective</i> labour which has achieved an independent position vis-\u00e0-vis it. This perpetuation of the relation of capital as buyer and the worker as seller of labour is a <i>form</i> of mediation which is immanent in this mode of production; but it is a form which is only distinct in a formal sense from other, more direct, forms of the enslavement of labour and <i>property in labour</i> on the part of the owner of the conditions of production. It <i>glosses over</i> as a mere <i>money relation</i> the real transaction and the perpetual dependence, which is constantly renewed through this mediation of sale and purchase. Not only are the conditions of this <i>commerce</i> constantly reproduced; in addition to this, what one buys with, and what the other is obliged to sell, is the result of the process. The constant renewal of this relation of <i>sale and purchase</i> only mediates the permanence of the specific relation of dependence, giving it the deceptive <i>semblance</i> of a transaction, a contract, between <i>commodity owners</i> who have equal rights and confront each other equally freely. This <i>initial</i> relation now appears as itself an immanent moment of the domination, produced in capitalist production, of objective labour over living labour.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p12\"></a>Hence both these groups are mistaken:</p>", "<p><a id=\"p13\"></a>those who regard wage labour, the sale of labour to capital, and therefore the form of the <i>wage system</i>, as <i>external</i> to capitalist production; it is an <i>essential form</i> of mediation of the capitalist production relation, constantly produced anew by this relation itself;</p>", "<p><a id=\"p14\"></a>and those who find the <i>essence</i> of the capital-relation in this superficial relation, in this <i>essential formality</i>, this <i>semblance</i> of the capital-relation, and therefore pretend to characterise the relation by subsuming workers and capitalists together under the general relation of <i>commodity owners</i>, thereby engaging in apologetics and extinguishing the <i>differentia specifica</i> of the capital-relation.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p15\"></a>2) For the capital-relation to occur at all, a definite historical stage and form of social production is presupposed. Means of communication and production, and needs, have first to develop within an earlier mode of production which go beyond the old relations of production and enforce their transformation into the capital-relation. But they only need to be sufficiently developed to allow the formal subsumption of labour under capital to take place. On the basis of this altered relation, however, specific changes in the mode of production develop, creating new material forces of production, on the basis of which the new mode of production first develops and therewith in fact creates new real conditions for itself. A complete economic revolution thus takes place. On the one hand it creates, for the first time, the real conditions for the domination of capital over labour, completing them, giving them an appropriate form, and on the other hand, in the productive powers of labour developed by it in opposition to the worker, in the conditions of production and relations of communication, it creates the real conditions for a new mode of production, superseding the antagonistic form of the capitalist mode of production, and thus lays the material basis for a newly shaped social life process and therewith a new social formation.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p16\"></a>This is an essentially different conception from that of the bourgeois political economists, themselves imprisoned in capitalist preconceptions, who are admittedly able to see how production is carried on <i>within</i> the capital-relation, but not how this <i>relation</i> is itself produced, and how at the same time the material conditions for its dissolution are produced within it, thereby removing its <i>historical justification</i> as a <i>necessary form</i> of economic development, of the production of social wealth.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p17\"></a>In contrast to this, we have seen not only how capital produces, but how it is itself produced, and how it emerges from the production process in a form essentially different from that in which it entered the process.

This is done not merely for the sake of connection and completeness. The presentation of the subject-matter is improved. As far as circumstances in any way permit, many points only hinted at in the earlier book are here worked out more fully, whilst, conversely, points worked out fully there are only touched upon in this volume. The sections on the history of the theories of value and of money are now, of course, left out altogether. The reader of the earlier work will find, however, in the notes to the first chapter additional sources of reference relative to the history of those theories.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>Every beginning is difficult, holds in all sciences. To understand the first chapter, especially the section that contains the analysis of commodities, will, therefore, present the greatest difficulty. That which concerns more especially the analysis of the substance of value and the magnitude of value, I have, as much as it was possible, popularised. [This is the more necessary, as even the section of Ferdinand Lassalle\u2019s work against Schulze-Delitzsch, in which he professes to give \u201cthe intellectual quintessence\u201d of my explanations on these subjects, contains important mistakes. If Ferdinand Lassalle has borrowed almost literally from my writings, and without any acknowledgement, all the general theoretical propositions in his economic works, e.g., those on the historical character of capital, on the connection between the conditions of production and the mode of production, &amp;c., &amp;c., even [down] to the terminology created by me, this may perhaps be due to purposes of propaganda. I am here, of course, not speaking of his detailed working out and application of these propositions, with which I have nothing to do. <i>[Marx]</i>] The value form, whose fully developed shape is the money form, is very elementary and simple. Nevertheless, the human mind has for more than 2,000 years sought in vain to get to the bottom of it, whilst on the other hand, to the successful analysis of much more composite and complex forms, there has been at least an approximation. Why? Because the body, as an organic whole, is more easy of study than are the cells of that body. In the analysis of economic forms, moreover, neither microscopes nor chemical reagents are of use. The force of abstraction must replace both. But in bourgeois society the commodity form of the product of labour \u2014 or the value form of the commodity \u2014 is the economic cell form. To the superficial observer, the analysis of these forms seems to turn upon minutiae. It does in fact deal with minutiae, but they are of the same order as those dealt with in microscopic anatomy.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>With the exception of the section on value form, therefore, this volume cannot stand accused on the score of difficulty.

In this work I have to examine the capitalist mode of production, and the conditions of production and exchange corresponding to that mode. Up to the present time, their classic ground is England. That is the reason why England is used as the chief illustration in the development of my theoretical ideas. If, however, the German reader shrugs his shoulders at the condition of the English industrial and agricultural labourers, or in optimist fashion comforts himself with the thought that in Germany things are not nearly so bad, I must plainly tell him, <i>\u201cDe te fabula narratur!\u201d</i>.

It is a question of these laws themselves, of these tendencies working with iron necessity towards inevitable results. The country that is more developed industrially only shows, to the less developed, the image of its own future.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>But apart from this. Where capitalist production is fully naturalised among the Germans (for instance, in the factories proper) the condition of things is much worse than in England, because the counterpoise of the Factory Acts is wanting. In all other spheres, we, like all the rest of Continental Western Europe, suffer not only from the development of capitalist production, but also from the incompleteness of that development. Alongside of modern evils, a whole series of inherited evils oppress us, arising from the passive survival of antiquated modes of production, with their inevitable train of social and political anachronisms. We suffer not only from the living, but from the dead. <i>Le mart saisit le vif!</i> [<i>Le mort saisit le vif, son hoir le plus proche et habile \u00e0 lui succ\u00e9der</i> (The dead holds the living in his grasp...) \u2014 a formula of the French common law.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>The social statistics of Germany and the rest of Continental Western Europe are, in comparison with those of England, wretchedly compiled. But they raise the veil just enough to let us catch a glimpse of the Medusa head behind it. We should be appalled at the state of things at home, if, as in England, our governments and parliaments appointed periodically commissions of inquiry into economic conditions; if these commissions were armed with the same plenary powers to get at the truth; if it was possible to find for this purpose men as competent, as free from partisanship and respect of persons as are the English factory inspectors, her medical reporters on public health, her commissioners of inquiry into the exploitation of women and children, into housing and food. Perseus wore a magic cap that the monsters he hunted down might not see him. We draw the magic cap down over eyes and ears as a make-believe that there are no monsters.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>Let us not deceive ourselves on this. As in the 18th century, the American War of Independence sounded the tocsin for the European middle class, so in the 19th century, the American Civil War sounded it for the European working class. In England the progress of social disintegration is palpable. When it has reached a certain point, it must re-act on the Continent. There it will take a form more brutal or more humane, according to the degree of development of the working class itself. Apart from higher motives, therefore, their own most important interests dictate to the classes that are for the nonce the ruling ones, the removal of all legally removable hindrances to the free development of the working class. For this reason, as well as others, I have given so large a space in this volume to the history, the details, and the results of English factory legislation. One nation can and should learn from others. And even when a society has got upon the right track for the discovery of the natural laws of its movement \u2014 and it is the ultimate aim of this work, to lay bare the economic law of motion of modern society \u2014 it can neither clear by bold leaps, nor remove by legal enactments, the obstacles offered by the successive phases of its normal development. But it can shorten and lessen the birth-pangs.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p10\"></a>To prevent possible misunderstanding, a word. I paint the capitalist and the landlord in no sense <i>couleur de rose</i>. But here individuals are dealt with only in so far as they are the personifications of economic categories, embodiments of particular class relations and class interests. My standpoint, from which the evolution of the economic formation of society is viewed as a process of natural history, can less than any other make the individual responsible for relations whose creature he socially remains, however much he may subjectively raise himself above them.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p11\"></a>In the domain of political economy, free scientific inquiry meets not merely the same enemies as in all other domains. The peculiar nature of the material it deals with, summons as foes into the field of battle the most violent, mean and malignant passions of the human breast, the Furies of private interest. The English Established Church, e.g., will more readily pardon an attack on 38 of its 39 articles than on 1/39 of its income. Now-a-days atheism itself is <i>culpa levis</i> [venial sin], as compared with criticism of existing property relations. Nevertheless, there is an unmistakable advance. I refer, <i>e.g.</i>, to the Blue Book published within the last few weeks: \u201cCorrespondence with Her Majesty\u2019s Missions Abroad, regarding Industrial Questions and Trades\u2019 Unions\u201d. The representatives of the English Crown in foreign countries there declare in so many words that in Germany, in France, to be brief, in all the civilised states of the European Continent, a radical change in the existing relations between capital and labour is as evident and inevitable as in England. At the same time, on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, Mr. Wade, vice-president of the United States declared in public meetings that, after the abolition of slavery, a radical change of the relations of capital and of property in land is next upon the order of the day. These are signs of the times, not to be hidden by purple mantles or black cassocks. They do not signify that tomorrow a miracle will happen. They show that, within the ruling classes themselves, a foreboding is dawning, that the present society is no solid crystal, but an organism capable of change, and is constantly changing.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p12\"></a>The second volume of this work will treat of the process of the circulation of capital (Book II), and of the varied forms assumed by capital in the course ofits development (Book III), the third and last volume (Book IV), the history of the theory.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p13\"></a>Every opinion based on scientific criticism I welcome.

It says:</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p7\"></a>\u201cAt first sight, if the judgement is based on the external form of the presentation of the subject, Marx is the most ideal of ideal philosophers, always in the German, i.e., the bad sense of the word. But in point of fact he is infinitely more realistic than all his fore-runners in the work of economic criticism. [...] He can in no sense be called an idealist.\u201d</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>I cannot answer the writer better than by aid of a few extracts from his own criticism, which may interest some of my readers to whom the Russian original is inaccessible.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>After a quotation from the preface to my <i>Critique of Political Economy</i>, Berlin, 1859, pp. IV-VII, where I discuss the materialistic basis of my method, the writer goes on:</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p10\"></a>\u201cThe one thing which is of moment to Marx, is to find the law of the phenomena with whose investigation he is concerned; and not only is that law of moment to him, which governs these phenomena, in so far as they have a definite form and mutual connection within a given historical period. Of still greater moment to him is the law of their variation, of their development, i.e., of their transition from one form into another, from one series of connections into a different one. This law once discovered, he investigates in detail the effects in which it manifests itself in social life. [...] Consequently, Marx only troubles himself about one thing: to show, by rigid scientific investigation, the necessity of successive determinate orders of social conditions, and to establish, as impartially as possible, the facts that serve him for fundamental startingpoints. For this it is quite enough, if he proves, at the same time, both the necessity of the present order of things, and the necessity of another order into which the first must inevitably pass over; and this all the same, whether men believe or do not believe it, whether they are conscious or unconscious of it. Marx treats the social movement as a process of natural history, governed by laws not only independent of human will, consciousness and intelligence, but rather on the contrary, determining that will, consciousness and intelligence. If in the history of civilisation the conscious element plays a part so subordinate, then it is self-evident hat a critical inquiry whose subject-matter is civilisation, can, less than anything else, have for its basis any form of, or any result of, consciousness. That is to say, that not the idea, but the material phenomenon alone can serve as its starting-point. Much an inquiry will confine itself to the confrontation and the comparison of a fact, not with ideas, but with another fact. For this inquiry, the one thing of moment is, that both facts be investigated as accurately as possible, and that they actually form, each with respect to the other, different momenta of an evolution; but most important of all is the rigid analysis of the series of successions, of the sequences and concatenations in which the different stages of such an evolution present themselves. [...] But it will be said, [...] the general laws of economic life are one and the same, no matter whether they are applied to the present or the past. This Marx directly denies. According to him, such abstract laws do not exist. [...] On the contrary, in his opinion every historical period has laws of its own... As soon as society has outlived a given period of development, and is passing over from one given stage to another, it begins to be subject also to other laws. In a word, economic life offers us a phenomenon analogous to the history of evolution in other branches of biology. [...] The old economists misunderstood the nature of economic laws when they likened them to the laws of physics and chemistry. [...] A more thorough analysis of phenomena shows that social organisms differ among themselves as fundamentally as plants or animals. Nay, one and the same phenomenon falls under quite different laws in consequence of the different structure of those organisms as a whole, of the variations of their individual organs, of the different conditions in which those organs function, &amp;c. Marx, e.g., denies that the law of population is the same at all times and in all places. He asserts, on the contrary, that every stage of development has its own law of population... With the varying degree of development of productive power, social conditions and the laws governing them vary too. Whilst Marx sets himself the task of following and explaining from this point of view the economic system established by the sway of capital, he is only formulating, in a strictly scientific manner, the aim that every accurate investigation into economic life must have. [...] The scientific value of such an inquiry lies in the disclosing of the special laws that regulate the origin, existence, development, death of a given social organism and its replacement by another and higher one. And it is this value that, in point of fact, Marx\u2019s book has.\u201d</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p11\"></a>Whilst the writer pictures what he takes to be actually my method, in this striking and [as far as concerns my own application of it] generous way, what else is he picturing but the dialectic method?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p12\"></a>Of course the method of presentation must differ in form from that of inquiry. The latter has to appropriate the material in detail, to analyse its different forms of development, to trace out their inner connection. Only after this work is done, can the actual movement be adequately described. If this is done successfully, if the life of the subject-matter is ideally reflected as in a mirror, then it may appear as if we had before us a mere a priori construction.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p13\"></a>My dialectic method is not only different from the Hegelian, but is its direct opposite. To Hegel, the life process of the human brain, i.e., the process of thinking, which, under the name of \u201cthe Idea\u201d, he even transforms into an independent subject, is the demiurgos of the real world, and the real world is only the external, phenomenal form of \u201cthe Idea\u201d. With me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing else than the material world reflected by the human mind, and translated into forms of thought.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p14\"></a>The mystifying side of Hegelian dialectic I criticised nearly thirty years ago, at a time when it was still the fashion. But just as I was working at the first volume of <i>Das Kapital</i>, it was the good pleasure of the peevish, arrogant, mediocre \u0388\u03c0\u03af\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 who now talk large in cultured Germany, to treat Hegel in same way as the brave Moses Mendelssohn in Lessing\u2019s time treated Spinoza, i.e., as a \u201cdead dog\u201d. I therefore openly avowed myself the pupil of that mighty thinker, and even here and there, in the chapter on the theory of value, coquetted with the modes of expression peculiar to him. The mystification which dialectic suffers in Hegel\u2019s hands, by no means prevents him from being the first to present its general form of working in a comprehensive and conscious manner. With him it is standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again, if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p15\"></a>In its mystified form, dialectic became the fashion in Germany, because it seemed to transfigure and to glorify the existing state of things. In its rational form it is a scandal and abomination to bourgeoisdom and its doctrinaire professors, because it includes in its comprehension and affirmative recognition of the existing state of things, at the same time also, the recognition of the negation of that state, of its inevitable breaking up; because it regards every historically developed social form as in fluid movement, and therefore takes into account its transient nature not less than its momentary existence; because it lets nothing impose upon it, and is in its essence critical and revolutionary.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p16\"></a>The contradictions inherent in the movement of capitalist society impress themselves upon the practical bourgeois most strikingly in the changes of the periodic cycle, through which modern industry runs, and whose crowning point is the universal crisis. That crisis is once again approaching, although as yet but in its preliminary stage; and by the universality of its theatre and the intensity of its action it will drum dialectics even into the heads of the mushroom-upstarts of the new, holy Prusso-German empire.</p>", "<p class=\"right\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a id=\"p17\"></a><i>Karl Marx</i></p>", "<p class=\"noind\"><a id=\"p18\"></a>London, January 24, 1873</p>"], "year": "1873", "sourceBook": "Capital.

We there stated, p. 176: \u201cIf we examine the whole process from the point of view of its result, the product, it is plain that both the instruments and the subject of labour, are means of production, and that the labour itself is productive labour.\u201d And in Note 2, same page, we further added: \u201cThis method of determining, from the standpoint of the labour process alone, what is productive labour, is by no means directly applicable to the case of the capitalist process of production.\u201d We now proceed to the further development of this subject.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p2\"></a>So far as the labour process is purely individual, one and the same labourer unites in himself all the functions, that later on become separated. When an individual appropriates natural objects for his livelihood, no one controls him but himself. Afterwards he is controlled by others. A single man cannot operate upon Nature without calling his own muscles into play under the control of his own brain. As in the natural body head and hand wait upon each other, so the labour process unites the labour of the hand with that of the head. Later on they part company and even become deadly foes. The product ceases to be the direct product of the individual, and becomes a social product, produced in common by a collective labourer, i.e., by a combination of workmen, each of whom takes only a part, greater or less, in the manipulation of the subject of their labour. As the co-operative character of the labour process becomes more and more marked, so, as a necessary consequence, does our notion of productive labour, and of its agent the productive labourer, become extended. In order to labour productively, it is no longer necessary for you to do manual work yourself; enough, if you are an organ of the collective labourer, and perform one of its subordinate functions. The first definition given above of productive labour, a definition deduced from the very nature of the production of material objects, still remains correct for the collective labourer, considered as a whole. But it no longer holds good for each member taken individually.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>On the other hand, however, our notion of productive labour becomes narrowed. Capitalist production is not merely the production of commodities, it is essentially the production of surplus value. The labourer produces, not for himself, but for capital. It no longer suffices, therefore, that he should simply produce. He must produce surplus value. That labourer alone is productive, who produces surplus value for the capitalist, and thus works for the self-expansion of capital. If we may take an example from outside the sphere of production of material objects, a schoolmaster is a productive labourer, when, in addition to belabouring the heads of his scholars, he works like a horse to enrich the school proprietor. That the latter has laid out his capital in a teaching factory, instead of in a sausage factory, does not alter the relation. Hence the notion of a productive labourer implies not merely a relation between work and useful effect, between labourer and product of labour, but also a specific, social relation of production, a relation that has sprung up historically and stamps the labourer as the direct means of creating surplus value. To be a productive labourer is, therefore, not a piece of luck, but a misfortune.</p>", "<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p4\"></a>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"stea\"><b>***</b></span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>The prolongation of the working day beyond the point at which the labourer would have produced just an equivalent for the value of his labour power, and the appropriation of that surplus labour by capital, this is production of absolute surplus value. It forms the general groundwork of the capitalist system, and the starting-point for the production of relative surplus value. The latter presupposes that the working day is already divided into two parts, necessary labour, and surplus labour. In order to prolong the surplus labour, the necessary labour is shortened by methods whereby the equivalent for the wages is produced in less time. The production of absolute surplus value turns exclusively upon the length of the working day; the production of relative surplus value, revolutionises out and out the technical processes of labour, and the composition of society. It therefore presupposes a specific mode, the capitalist mode of production, a mode which, along with its methods, means, and conditions, arises and develops itself spontaneously on the foundation afforded by the formal subjection of labour to capital.

But if we keep in mind the behaviour of surplus value, this appearance of identity vanishes. Once the capitalist mode of production established and become general, the difference between absolute and relative surplus value makes itself felt, whenever there is a question of raising the rate of surplus value. Assuming that labour power is paid for at its value, we are confronted by this alternative: given the productiveness of labour and its normal intensity, the rate of surplus value can be raised only by the actual prolongation of the working day; on the other hand, given the length of the working day, that rise can be effected only by a change in the relative magnitudes of the components of the working day, viz., necessary labour and surplus labour; a change which, if the wages are not to fall below the value of labour power, presupposes a change either in the productiveness or in the intensity of the labour.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>If the labourer wants all his time to produce the necessary means of subsistence for himself and his race, he has no time left in which to work gratis for others.

But the accumulation of capital presupposes surplus value; surplus value presupposes capitalistic production; capitalistic production presupposes the pre-existence of considerable masses of capital and of labour power in the hands of producers of commodities. The whole movement, therefore, seems to turn in a vicious circle, out of which we can only get by supposing a primitive accumulation (previous accumulation of Adam Smith) preceding capitalistic accumulation; an accumulation not the result of the capitalist mode of production, but its starting point.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p2\"></a>This primitive accumulation plays in political economy about the same part as original sin in theology. Adam bit the apple, and thereupon sin fell on the human race. Its origin is supposed to be explained when it is told as an anecdote of the past. In times long gone by there were two sorts of people; one, the diligent, intelligent, and, above all, frugal elite; the other, lazy rascals, spending their substance, and more, in riotous living. The legend of theological original sin tells us certainly how man came to be condemned to eat his bread in the sweat of his brow; but the history of economic original sin reveals to us that there are people to whom this is by no means essential. Never mind! Thus it came to pass that the former sort accumulated wealth, and the latter sort had at last nothing to sell except their own skins. And from this original sin dates the poverty of the great majority that, despite all its labour, has up to now nothing to sell but itself, and the wealth of the few that increases constantly although they have long ceased to work. Such insipid childishness is every day preached to us in the defence of property. M. Thiers, e.g., had the assurance to repeat it with all the solemnity of a statesman, to the French people, once so <i>spirituel</i>. But as soon as the question of property crops up, it becomes a sacred duty to proclaim the intellectual food of the infant as the one thing fit for all ages and for all stages of development. In actual history it is notorious that conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, briefly, force, play the great part. In the tender annals of political economy, the idyllic reigns from time immemorial. Right and \u201clabour\u201d were from all time the sole means of enrichment, the present year of course always excepted. As a matter of fact, the methods of primitive accumulation are anything but idyllic.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>In themselves money and commodities are no more capital than are the means of production and of subsistence. They want transforming into capital. But this transformation itself can only take place under certain circumstances that centre in this, viz., that two very different kinds of commodity possessors must come face to face and into contact; on the one hand, the owners of money, means of production, means of subsistence, who are eager to increase the sum of values they possess, by buying other people\u2019s labour power; on the other hand, free labourers, the sellers of their own labour power, and therefore the sellers of labour. Free labourers, in the double sense that neither they themselves form part and parcel of the means of production, as in the case of slaves, bondsmen, &amp;c., nor do the means of production belong to them, as in the case of peasant proprietors; they are therefore, free from, unencumbered by, any means of production of their own. With this polarisation of the market for commodities, the fundamental conditions of capitalist production are given. The capitalist system presupposes the complete separation of the labourers from all property in the means by which they can realise their labour. As soon as capitalist production is once on its own legs, it not only maintamts this separation, but reproduces it on a continually extending scale. The process therefore that clears the way for the capitalist system, can be none other than the process which takes away from the labourer the possession of his means of production; a process that transforms, on the one hand, the social means of subsistence and of production into capital, on the other the immediate producers into wage labourers. The so-called primitive accumulation therefore, is nothing else than the historical process of divorcing the producer from the means of production. It appears as primitive, because it forms the pre-historic stage of capital and of the mode of production corresponding with it.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>The economic structure of capitalistic society has grown out of the economic structure of feudal society. The dissolution of the latter set free the elements of the former.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>The immediate producer, the labourer, could only dispose of his own person after he had ceased to be attached to the soil and ceased to be the slave, serf, or bondman of another. To become a free seller of labour power, who carries his commodity wherever he finds a market, he must further have escaped from the regime of the guilds, their rules for apprentices and journeymen, and the impediments of their labour regulations. Hence, the historical movement which changes the producers into wage workers, appears, on the one hand, as their emancipation from serfdom and from the fetters of the guilds, and this side alone exists for our bourgeois historians. But, on the other hand, these new freedmen became sellers of themselves only after they had been robbed of all their own means of production, and of all the guarantees of existence afforded by the old feudal arrangements. And the history of this, their expropriation, is written in the annals of mankind in letters of blood and fire.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>The industrial capitalists, these new potentates, had on their part not only to displace the guild masters of handicrafts, but also the feudal lords, the possessors of the sources of wealth. In this respect their conquest of social power appears as the fruit of a victorious struggle both against feudal lordship and its revolting prerogatives, and against the guilds and the fetters they laid on the free development of production and the free exploitation of man by man. The chevaliers d\u2019industrie, however, only succeeded in supplanting the chevaliers of the sword by making use of events of which they themselves were wholly innocent.

The advance consisted in a change of form of this servitude, in the transformation of feudal exploitation into capitalist exploitation. To understand its march, we need not go back very far. Although we come across the first beginnings of capitalist production as early as the 14th or 15th century, sporadically, in certain towns of the Mediterranean, the capitalistic era dates from the 16th century. Wherever it appears, the abolition of serfdom has been long effected, and the highest development of the Middle Ages, the existence of sovereign towns, has been long on the wane.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>In the history of primitive accumulation, all revolutions are epochmaking that act as levers for the capitalist class in course of formation; but, above all, those moments when great masses of men are suddenly and forcibly torn from their means of subsistence, and hurled as free and \u201cunattached\u201d proletarians on the labour market. The expropriation of the agricultural producer, of the peasant, from the soil, is the basis of the whole process.

In so far as it is not immediate transformation of slaves and serfs into wage labourers, and therefore a mere change of form, it only means the expropriation of the immediate producers, i.e., the dissolution of private property based on the labour of its owner. Private property, as the antithesis to social, collective property, exists only where the means of labour and the external conditions of labour belong to private individuals. But according as these private individuals are labourers or not labourers, private property has a different character. The numberless shades, that it at first sight presents, correspond to the intermediate stages lying between these two extremes. The private property of the labourer in his means of production is the foundation of petty industry, whether agricultural, manufacturing, or both; petty industry, again, is an essential condition for the development of social production and of the free individuality of the labourer himself. Of course, this petty mode of production exists also under slavery, serfdom, and other states of dependence. But it flourishes, it lets loose its whole energy, it attains its adequate classical form, only where the labourer is the private owner of his own means of labour set in action by himself: the peasant of the land which he cultivates, the artisan of the tool which he handles as a virtuoso. This mode of production presupposes parcelling of the soil, and scattering of the other means of production. As it excludes the concentration of these means of production, so also it excludes co-operation, division of labour within each separate process of production, the control over, and the productive application of the forces of Nature by society, and the free development of the social productive powers. It is compatible only with a system of production, and a society, moving within narrow and more or less primitive bounds. To perpetuate it would be, as Pecqueur rightly says, \u201cto decree universal mediocrity\u201d. At a certain stage of development it brings forth the material agencies for its own dissolution. From that moment new forces and new passions spring up in the bosom of society; but the old social organisation fetters them and keeps them down. It must be annihilated; it is annihilated. Its annihilation, the transformation of the individualised and scattered means of production into socially concentrated ones of the pigmy property of the many into the huge property of the few, the expropriation of the great mass of the people from the soil, from the means of subsistence, and from the means of labour, this fearful and painful expropriation ot the mass ot the people forms the prelude to the history of capital. It comprises a series of forcible methods, of which we have passed in review only those that have been epoch-making as methods of the primitive accumulation of capital. The expropriation of the immediate producers was accomplished with merciless Vandalism, and under the stimulus of passions the most infamous, the most sordid, the pettiest, the most meanly odious. Self-earned private property, that is based, so to say, on the fusing together of the isolated, independent labouring individual with the conditions of his labour, is supplanted by capitalistic private property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labour of others, i.e., on wage labour.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p2\"></a>As soon as this process of transformation has sufficiently decomposed the old society from top to bottom, as soon as the labourers are turned into proletarians, their means of labour into capital, as soon as the capitalist mode of production stands on its own feet, then the further socialisation of labour and further transformation of the land and other means of production into socially exploited and, therefore, common means of production, as well as the further expropriation of private proprietors, takes a new form. That which is now to be expropriated is no longer the labourer working for himself, but the capitalist exploiting many labourers. This expropriation is accomplished by the action of the immanent laws of capitalistic production itself, by the centralisation of capital. One capitalist always kills many. Hand in hand with this centralisation, or this expropriation of many capitalists by few, develop, on an ever-extending scale, the co-operative form of the labour process, the conscious technical application of science, the methodical cultivation of the soil, the transformation of the instruments of labour into instruments of labour only usable in common, the economising of all means of production by their use as the means of production of combined, socialised labour, the entanglement of all peoples in the net of the world market, and with this, the international character of the capitalistic r\u00e9gime. Along with the constantly diminishing number of the magnates of capital, who usurp and monopolise all advantages of this process of transformation, grows the mass of misery, oppression, slavery, degradation, exploitation; but with this too grows the revolt of the working class, a class always increasing in numbers, and disciplined, united, organised by the very mechanism of the process of capitalist production itself. The monopoly of capital becomes a fetter upon the mode of production, which has sprung up and nourished along with, and under it. Centralisation of the means of production and socialisation of labour at last reach a point where they become incompatible with their capitalist integument. Thus integument is burst asunder.

The expropriators are expropriated.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>The capitalist mode of appropriation, the result of the capitalist mode of production, produces capitalist private property.

It is the negation of negation. This does not re-establish private property for the producer, but gives him individual property based on the acquisitions of the capitalist era: i.e., on co-operation and the possession in common of the land and of the means of production.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>The transformation of scattered private property, arising from individual labour, into capitalist private property is, naturally, a process, incomparably more protracted, violent, and difficult, than the transformation of capitalistic private property, already practically resting on socialised production, into socialised property.

The fact that the development of the productive power in different lines of industry proceeds at substantially different rates and frequently even in opposite directions, is not due merely to the anarchy of competition and the peculiarity of the bourgeois mode of production. Productivity of labour is also bound up with natural conditions, which frequently become less productive as productivity grows \u2014 inasmuch as the latter depends on social conditions. Hence the opposite movements in these different spheres \u2014 progress here, and retrogression there.

If five labourers produce ten times as much of a commodity as before, this does not increase the outlay for fixed capital ten-fold; although the value of this part of constant capital increases with the development of the productive power it does not by any means increase in the same proportion. We have frequently pointed out the difference in the ratio of constant to variable capital as expressed in the fall of the rate of profit, and the difference in the same ratio as expressed in relation to the individual commodity and its price with the development of the productivity of labour.</p>", "<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p3\"></a>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"stea\"><b>***</b></span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>Under competition, the increasing minimum of capital required with the increase in productivity for the successful operation of an independent industrial establishment, assumes the following aspect: As soon as the new, more expensive equipment has become universally established, smaller capitals are henceforth excluded from this industry. Smaller capitals can carry on independently in the various spheres of production only in the infancy of mechanical inventions. Very large undertakings, such as railways, on the other hand, which have an unusually high proportion of constant capital, do not yield the average rate of profit, but only a portion of it, only an interest. Otherwise the general rate of profit would have fallen still lower. But this offers direct employment to large concentrations of capital in the form of stocks.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>Growth of capital, hence accumulation of capital, does not imply a fall in the rate of profit, unless it is accompanied by the aforementioned changes in the proportion of the organic constituents of capital. Now it so happens that in spite of the constant daily revolutions in the mode of production, now this and now that larger or smaller portion of the total capital continues to accumulate for certain periods on the basis of a given average proportion of those constituents, so that there is no organic change with its growth, and consequently no cause for a fall in the rate of profit. This constant expansion of capital, hence also an expansion of production, on the basis of the old method of production which goes quietly on while new methods are already being introduced at its side, is another reason, why the rate of profit does not decline as much as the total capital of society grows.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>The increase in the absolute number of labourers does not occur in all branches of production, and not uniformly in all, in spite of the relative decrease of variable capital laid out in wages.

Labour power becomes redundant for it as soon as it is no longer necessary to employ it for 12 to 15 hours daily. A development of productive forces which would diminish the absolute number of labourers, i.e., enable the entire nation to accomplish its total production in a shorter time span, would cause a revolution, because it would put the bulk of the population out of the running. This is another manifestation of the specific barrier of capitalist production, showing also that capitalist production is by no means an absolute form for the development of the productive forces and for the creation of wealth, but rather that at a certain point it comes into collision with this development. This collision appears partly in periodical crises, which arise from the circumstance that now this and now that portion of the labouring population becomes redundant under its old mode of employment. The limit of capitalist production is the excess time of the labourers. The absolute spare time gained by society does not concern it. The development of the productive power concerns it only in so far as it increases the surplus labour time of the working class, not because it decreases the labour time for material production in general. It moves thus in a contradiction.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>We have seen that the growing accumulation of capital implies its growing concentration. Thus grows the power of capital, the alienation of the conditions of social production personified in the capitalist from the real producers. Capital comes more and more to the fore as a social power, whose agent is the capitalist. This social power no longer stands in any possible relation to that which the labour of a single individual can create. It becomes an estranged, independent, social power, which stands opposed to society as an object, and as an object that is the capitalist\u2019s source of power. The contradiction between the general social power into which capital develops, on the one hand, and the private power of the individual capitalists over these social conditions of production, on the other, becomes ever more irreconcilable, and yet contains the solution of the problem, because it implies at the same time the transformation of the conditions of production into general, common, social, conditions. This transformation stems from the development of the productive forces under capitalist production, and from the ways and means by which this development takes place.</p>", "<table style=\"width: 20%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><a id=\"p9\"></a>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><hr/>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>", "<p><a id=\"p10\"></a>No capitalist ever voluntarily introduces a new method of production, no matter how much more productive it may be, and how much it may increase the rate of surplus value, so long as it reduces the rate of profit. Yet every such new method of production cheapens the commodities. Hence, the capitalist sells them originally above their prices of production, or, perhaps, above their value. He pockets the difference between their costs of production and the market prices of the same commodities produced at higher costs of production. He can do this, because the average labour time required socially for the production of these latter commodities is higher than the labour time required for the new methods of production. His method of production stands above the social average. But competition makes it general and subject to the general law. There follows a fall in the rate of profit \u2014 perhaps first in this sphere of production, and eventually it achieves a balance with the rest \u2014 which is, therefore, wholly independent of the will of the capitalist.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p11\"></a>It is still to be added to this point, that this same law also governs those spheres of production, whose product passes neither directly nor indirectly into the consumption of the labourers, or into the conditions under which their necessities are produced; it applies, therefore, also to those spheres of production, in which there is no cheapening of commodities to increase the relative surplus value or cheapen labour power. (At any rate, a cheapening of constant capital in all these branches may increase the rate of profit, with the exploitation of labour remaining the same.) As soon as the new production method begins to spread, and thereby to furnish tangible proof that these commodities can actually be produced more cheaply, the capitalists working with the old methods of production must sell their product below its full price of production, because the value of this commodity has fallen, and because the labour time required by them to produce it is greater than the social average.

The less rapid the wear of machinery, the more the commodities over which it is distributed, and the more living labour it replaces before its term of reproduction arrives.

E.</i>] have seen that the capitalist process of production is a historically determined form of the social process of production in general. The latter is as much a production process of material conditions of human life as a process taking place under specific historical and economic production relations, producing and reproducing these production relations themselves, and thereby also the bearers of this process, their material conditions of existence and their mutual relations, i.e., their particular socio-economic form. For the aggregate of these relations, in which the agents of this production stand with respect to Nature and to one another, and in which they produce, is precisely society, considered from the standpoint of its economic structure. Like all its predecessors, the capitalist process of production proceeds under definite material conditions, which are, however, simultaneously the bearers of definite social relations entered into by individuals in the process of reproducing their life. Those conditions, like these relations, are on the one hand prerequisites, on the other hand results and creations of the capitalist process of production; they are produced and reproduced by it. We saw also that capital \u2014 and the capitalist is merely capital personified and functions in the process of production solely as the agent of capital \u2014 in its corresponding social process of production, pumps a definite quantity of surplus labour out of the direct producers, or labourers; capital obtains this surplus labour without an equivalent, and in essence it always remains forced labour \u2014 no matter how much it may seem to result from free contractual agreement. This surplus labour appears as surplus value, and this surplus value exists as a surplus product. Surplus labour in general, as labour performed over and above the given requirements, must always remain. In the capitalist as well as in the slave system, etc., it merely assumes an antagonistic form and is supplemented by complete idleness of a stratum of society. A definite quantity of surplus labour is required as insurance against accidents, and by the necessary and progressive expansion of the process of reproduction in keeping with the development of the needs and the growth of population, which is called accumulation from the viewpoint of the capitalist. It is one of the civilising aspects of capital that it enforces this surplus labour in a manner and under conditions which are more advantageous to the development of the productive forces, social relations, and the creation of the elements for a new and higher form than under the preceding forms of slavery, serfdom, etc. Thus it gives rise to a stage, on the one hand, in which coercion and monopolisation of social development (including its material and intellectual advantages) by one portion of society at the expense of the other are eliminated; on the other hand, it creates the material means and embryonic conditions, making it possible in a higher form of society to combine this surplus labour with a greater reduction of time devoted to material labour in general. For, depending on the development of labour productivity, surplus labour may be large in a small total working day, and relatively small in a large total working day. If the necessary labour time = 3 and the surplus labour = 3 then the total working day = 6 and the rate of surplus labour = 100%. If the necessary labour = 9 and the surplus labour = 3, then the total working day = 12 and the rate of surplus labour only = 33<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>%. In that case, it depends upon the labour productivity how much use value shall be produced in a definite time, hence also in a definite surplus labour time. The actual wealth of society, and the possibility of constantly expanding its reproduction process, therefore, do not depend upon the duration of surplus labour, but upon its productivity and the more or less copious conditions of production under which it is performed. In fact, the realm of freedom actually begins only where labour which is determined by necessity and mundane considerations ceases; thus in the very nature of things it lies beyond the sphere of actual material production. Just as the savage must wrestle with Nature to satisfy his wants, to maintain and reproduce life, so must civilised man, and he must do so in all social formations and under all possible modes of production. With his development this realm of physical necessity expands as a result of his wants; but, at the same time, the forces of production which satisfy these wants also increase. Freedom in this field can only consist in socialised man, the associated producers, rationally regulating their interchange with Nature, bringing it under their common control, instead of being ruled by it as by the blind forces of Nature; and achieving this with the least expenditure of energy and under conditions most favourable to, and worthy of, their human nature. But it nonetheless still remains a realm of necessity. Beyond it begins that development of human energy which is an end in itself, the true realm of freedom, which, however can blossom forth only with this realm of necessity as its basis. The shortening of the working day is its basic prerequisite.</p>"], "year": "1863\u20141883", "sourceBook": "Capital.

We have seen that the continual tendency and law of development of the capitalist mode of production is more and more to divorce the means of production from labour, and more and more to concentrate the scattered means of production into large groups, thereby transforming labour into wage labour and the means of production into capital.

Since, however, they belong together, the independence of the two correlated aspects can only <i>show itself</i> forcibly, as a destructive process. It is just the <i>crisis</i> in which they assert their unity, the unity of the different aspects. The independence which these two linked and complimentary phases assume in relation to each other is forcibly destroyed. Thus the crisis manifests the unity of the two phases that have become independent of each other. There would be no crisis without this inner unity of factors that are apparently indifferent to each other. But no, says the apologetic economist.

Instead of speaking of wage labour, the term <span class=\"eng\">\u201cservices\u201d</span> is used. This word again omits the specific characteristic of wage labour and of its use \u2014 namely, that it increases the value of the commodities against which it is exchanged, that it creates surplus value \u2014 and in doing so, it disregards the specific relationship through which money and commodities are transformed into capital. <span class=\"eng\"><i>\u201cService\u201d</i></span> is labour seen only as use value (which is a side issue in capitalist production) just as the word \u201cproduct\u201d fails to express the essence of commodity and its inherent contradiction. It is quite consistent that money is then regarded merely as the medium in the exchange of products, and not as an essential and necessary form of existence of the commodity which must manifest itself as exchange value, as general social labour. Since the transformation of the commodity into mere use value (product) obliterates the essence of exchange value, it is just as easy to deny, or rather it is necessary to deny, that <i>money</i> is an essential aspect of the commodity and that in the process of metamorphosis it is <i>independent</i> of the original form of the commodity.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>Crises are thus reasoned out of existence here by forgetting or denying the first prerequisite of capitalist production: the existence of the product as a commodity, the duplication of the commodity in commodity and money, the consequent separation which takes place in the exchange of commodities and finally the relation of money or commodities to wage labour.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>Incidentally, those economists are no better who (like John Stuart Mill) want to explain the crises by these simple <i>possibilities</i> of crisis contained in the metamorphosis of commodities \u2014 such as the separation between purchase and sale.

They do not explain <i>why</i> the phases of the process come into such conflict that their inner unity can only assert itself through a crisis, through a violent process. This <i>separation</i> appears in the crisis; it is the elementary form of the crisis. To <i>explain</i> the crisis on the basis of this, its elementary form, is to explain the existence of the crisis by describing its most abstract form, that is to say, to explain the crisis by the crisis.</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p8\"></a>Ricardo says: \u201cNo man produces, but with a view to consume <i>or sell</i>, and he never sells, but with an intention to <i>purchase</i> some other commodity, which may be immediately useful to him, or which may contribute to <i>future production</i>. By producing, then, he necessarily becomes either the consumer of his own goods, [After this word Marx gives in brackets its English equivalent.] or the purchaser and consumer of the goods of some person. It is not to be supposed that he should, <i>for any length of time</i>, be ill-informed of the commodities which he can most advantageously produce, to attain the object which he has in view, namely, the <i>possession of other goods;</i> and, <i>therefore</i>, it is not probable that he will continually produce a commodity for which there is no demand\u201d [pp. 339-40].</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>This is the childish babble of a Say, but it is not worthy of Ricardo. In the first place, no capitalist produces in order to consume his product. And when speaking of capitalist production, it is right to say that: \u201cno man produces with a view to consume his own product\u201d, even if he uses portions of his product for industrial consumption. But here the point in question is private consumption. Previously it was forgotten that the product is a commodity. Now even the social division of labour is forgotten. In a situation where men produce for themselves, there are indeed no crises, but neither is there capitalist production. Nor have we ever heard that the ancients, with their slave production ever knew crises, although individual producers among the ancients too, did go bankrupt. The first part of the alternative is nonsense. The second as well. A man who has produced, does not have the choice of selling or not selling. He must <i>sell</i>. In the crisis there arises the very situation in which he cannot sell or can only sell below the cost price or must even sell at a positive loss. What difference does it make, therefore, to him or to us that he has produced in order to sell? The very question we want to solve is what has thwarted this good intention of his? Further:</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p10\"></a>\u201che never <i>sells</i>, but with an intention to <i>purchase</i> some other commodity, which may be immediately useful to him, or which may contribute to future production\u201d.</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p11\"></a>What a cosy description of bourgeois conditions! Ricardo even forgets that a person may <i>sell</i> in order to <i>pay</i>, and that these forced sales play a very significant role in the crises. The capitalist\u2019s immediate object in selling, is to turn his commodity, or rather his commodity capital, back into <i>money capital</i>, and thereby to <i>realise</i> his profit. Consumption \u2014 <span class=\"eng\">revenue</span> \u2014 is by no means the guiding motive in this process, although it is for the person who only sells <i>commodities</i> in order to transform them into means of subsistence. But this is not capitalist production, in which revenue appears as the result and not as the determining purpose. Everyone <i>sells</i> first of all in order to sell, that is to say, in order to transform commodities into money.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p12\"></a>During the crisis, a man may be very pleased, if he has <i>sold</i> his commodities without immediately thinking of a purchase. On the other hand, if the value that has been realised is again to be used as capital, it must go through the process of reproduction, that is, it must be exchanged for labour and commodities. But the crisis is precisely the phase of disturbance and interruption of the process of reproduction. And this disturbance cannot be explained by the fact that it does not occur in those times when there is no crisis. There is no doubt that no one <span class=\"eng\">\u201cwill continually produce a commodity for which there is no demand\u201d</span> ([pp. 339-]40), but no one is talking about such an absurd hypothesis. Nor has it anything to do with the problem. The immediate purpose of capitalist production is not <span class=\"eng\">\u201cthe possession of other goods\u201d</span>, but the <span class=\"eng\">appropriation of value, of money, of abstract wealth</span>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p13\"></a>Ricardo\u2019s statements here are also based on James Mill\u2019s proposition on the \u201cmetaphysical equilibrium of purchases and sales\u201d, which I examined previously \u2014 an equilibrium which sees <i>only</i> the unity, but not the separation in the processes of purchase and sale. Hence also Ricardo\u2019s assertion (following James Mill):</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p14\"></a>\u201cToo much of a <i>particular</i> commodity may be produced, of which there may be such a glut in the market, as not to repay the capital expended on it; but this cannot be the case with respect to <i>all</i> commodities\u201d ([pp.] 341-42).</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p15\"></a>Money is not only <span class=\"eng\">\u201cthe medium by which the exchange is effected\u201d</span> ([p.] 341), but at the same time <span class=\"eng\">the medium by which the exchange of produce with produce becomes dissolved into two acts, independent of each other, and distant from each other, in time and space</span>. With Ricardo, however, this false conception of money is due to the fact that he concentrates exclusively on the <i>quantitative determination</i> of exchange value, namely, that it = a definite quantity of labour time, forgetting on the other hand the <i>qualitative</i> characteristic, that individual labour must present itself as abstract general social labour only through its alienation. [(That Ricardo [regards] money merely as <i>means of circulation</i> is synonymous with his regarding <i>exchange value</i> as a merely transient form, and altogether as something purely formal in bourgeois or capitalist production, which is consequently for him not a specific definite mode of production, but simply <i>the</i> mode of production.) <i>[Marx]</i>]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p16\"></a>That only <i>particular</i> commodities, and not <i>all</i> kinds of commodities, can form <span class=\"eng\">\u201ca glut in the market\u201d</span> and that therefore overproduction can always only be partial, is a poor way out. In the first place, if we consider only the nature of the commodity, there is nothing to prevent <i>all commodities</i> from being superabundant on the market, and therefore all falling below their price. We are here only concerned with the factor of crisis. That is all commodities, apart from <i>money</i>. [The proposition] <i>the</i> commodity must be converted into money, only means that <i>all</i> commodities must do so. And just as the difficulty of undergoing this metamorphosis exists for an individual commodity, so it can exist for all commodities. The general nature of the metamorphosis of commodities \u2014 which includes the separation of purchase and sale just as it does their unity \u2014 instead of excluding the <i>possibility</i> of a <span class=\"eng\">general glut</span>, on the contrary, contains the possibility of a <span class=\"eng\">general glut</span>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p17\"></a>Ricardo\u2019s and similar types of <i>raisonnements</i> [reasoning] are moreover based not only on the relation of <i>purchase and sale</i>, but also on that of <i>demand</i> and <i>supply</i>, which we have to examine only when considering the competition of capitals. As Mill says purchase is sale, etc., therefore demand is supply and supply demand. But they also fall apart and can become independent of each other. At a given moment, the supply of all commodities can be greater than the demand for all commodities, since the demand for the <i>general commodity</i>, money, exchange value, is greater than the demand for all particular commodities, in other words the motive to turn the commodity into money, to realise its exchange value, prevails over the motive to transform the commodity again into use value.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p18\"></a>If the relation of demand and supply is taken in a wider and more concrete sense, then it comprises the relation of <i>production</i> and <i>consumption</i> as well. Here again, the unity of these two phases, which does exist and which forcibly asserts itself during the crisis, must be seen as opposed to the <i>separation</i> and <i>antagonism</i> of these two phases, separation and antagonism which exist just as much, and are moreover typical of bourgeois production.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p19\"></a>With regard to the contradiction between partial and universal overproduction, in so far as the existence of the former is affirmed in order to evade the latter, the following observation may be made:</p>", "<p><a id=\"p20\"></a><i>Firstly:</i> Crises are usually preceded by a general <span class=\"eng\">inflation</span> in <span class=\"eng\">prices</span> of all articles of capitalist production. All of them therefore participate in the subsequent <span class=\"eng\">crash</span>, and at their prices before the <span class=\"eng\">crash, overburdening the market</span>. The market can absorb a larger volume of commodities at falling prices, at prices which have fallen below their cost prices, than it could absorb at their former prices. The excess of commodities is always relative; in other words it is an excess at particular prices. The prices at which the commodities are then absorbed are ruinous for the producer or merchant.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p21\"></a><i>Secondly:</i></p>", "<p><a id=\"p22\"></a>For a crisis (and therefore also for overproduction) to be general, it suffices for it to affect the principal commercial goods.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p23\"></a>Let us take a closer look at how Ricardo seeks to deny the possibility of a <span class=\"eng\">general glut</span> in <span class=\"eng\">the market</span>:</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p24\"></a>\u201cToo much of a particular commodity may be produced, of which there may be such a glut in the market, as not to repay the capital expended on it; but this cannot be the case with respect to all commodities; the demand for corn is limited by the mouths which are to eat it, for shoes and coats by the persons who are to wear them; but though a community, or a part of a community, may have as much corn, and as many hats and shoes, as it is able or may wish to consume, <i>the same cannot be said of every commodity produced by nature or by art</i>. Some would consume more wine, if they had the ability to procure it. Others having enough of wine, would wish to increase the quantity or improve the quality of their furniture. Others might wish to ornament their grounds, or to enlarge their houses. The wish to do all or some of these is implanted in every man\u2019s breast; <i>nothing is required but the means, and nothing can afford the means, but an increase of production\u201d</i> (l.c., [pp.] 341-42).</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p25\"></a>Could there be a more childish <i>raisonnement?</i> It runs like this: more of a particular commodity may be produced than can be consumed of it; but this cannot apply to <i>all</i> commodities at the same time. Because the needs, which the commodities satisfy, have no limits and all these needs are not satisfied at the same time. On the contrary. The fulfilment of one need makes another, so to speak, latent. Thus nothing is required, but the means to satisfy these wants, and these means can only be provided through an increase in production. Hence no general overproduction is possible.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p26\"></a>What is the purpose of all this? In periods of overproduction, a large part of the nation (especially the working class) is less well provided than ever with corn, shoes, etc., not to speak of wine and <span class=\"eng\">furniture</span>. If overproduction could only occur when all the members of a nation had satisfied even their most urgent needs, there could never, in the history of bourgeois society up to now, have been a state of general overproduction or even of partial overproduction. When, for instance, <span class=\"eng\">the market is glutted by shoes or calicoes or wines or colonial produce</span>, does this perhaps mean that <sup>4</sup>/<sub>6</sub> of the nation have more than satisfied their needs in shoes, <span class=\"eng\">calicoes</span>, etc.? What after all has overproduction to do with absolute needs? It is only concerned with demand that is backed by ability to pay. It is not a question of absolute overproduction \u2014 overproduction as such in relation to the absolute need or the desire to possess commodities. In this sense there is neither partial nor general overproduction; and the one is not opposed to the</p>", "<p><a id=\"p27\"></a>But \u2014 Ricardo will say \u2014 <span class=\"eng\">when there are a lot of people, who want shoes and calicoes, why do they not procure themselves the means of obtaining them by producing something wherewith to buy shoes and calicoes</span>? Would it not be even simpler to say: Why do they not produce shoes and calicoes for themselves? An even stranger aspect of overproduction is that the workers, the actual producers of the <span class=\"eng\">very commodities which glut the market stand in want of them</span>. It cannot be said here that they should produce things in order to <span class=\"eng\">obtain</span> them, for they have produced them and yet they have not got them.

If, therefore, it is even impossible to explain that <i>partial</i> overproduction arises because the demand for the commodities <span class=\"eng\">which glut the market</span> has been more than satisfied, it is quite impossible to explain away <i>universal</i> overproduction by declaring that needs, unsatisfied needs, exist for many of the commodities which are on the market.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p28\"></a>Let us keep to the example of the weaver of <span class=\"eng\">calico</span>.

If this difficulty, the sale, is solved then the purchase, <i>M\u2014C</i>, presents no difficulty, since money is directly exchangeable for everything else. The use value of the commodity, the usefulness of the labour contained in it, must be assumed from the start, otherwise it is no commodity at all. It is further assumed that the individual value of the commodity = its social value, that is to say, that the labour time materialised in it = the socially <i>necessary</i> labour time for the production of this commodity. The possibility of a crisis, in so far as it shows itself in the simple form of metamorphosis, thus only arises from the fact that the differences in form \u2014 the phases \u2014 which it passes through in the course of its progress, are in the first place necessarily complimentary and secondly, despite this intrinsic and necessary correlation, they are distinct parts and forms of the process, independent of each other, diverging in time and space, separable and separated from each other. The possibility of crisis therefore lies solely in the separation of sale from purchase. It is thus only in the form of commodity that the commodity has to pass through this difficulty here. As soon as it assumes the form of money it has got over this difficulty. Subsequently however this too resolves into the separation of sale and purchase. If the commodity could not be withdrawn from circulation in the form of money or its retransformation into commodity could not be postponed \u2014 as with direct barter \u2014 if purchase and sale coincided, then the <i>possibility</i> of crisis would, under the assumptions made, disappear. For it is assumed that the commodity represents use value for other owners of commodities. In the form of direct barter, the commodity is not exchangeable only if it has no use value or when there are no other use values on the other side which can be exchanged for it; therefore, only under these two conditions: either if one side has produced <i>useless</i> things or if the other side has nothing <i>useful</i> to exchange as an equivalent for the first use value. In both cases, however, no exchange whatsoever would take place. <i>But in so far as exchange did take place</i>, its phases would not be separated. The buyer would be seller and the seller buyer. The <i>critical</i> stage, which arises from the form of the exchange \u2014 in so far as it is circulation \u2014 would therefore cease to exist, and if we say that the simple form of metamorphosis comprises the possibility of crisis, we only say that in this form itself lies the possibility of the rupture and separation of essentially complimentary phases. But this applies also to the content. In direct barter, the bulk of production is intended by the producer to satisfy his own needs, or, where the division of labour is more developed, to satisfy the needs of his fellow producers, needs that are known to him. What is exchanged as a commodity is the surplus and it is unimportant whether this surplus is exchanged or not. In <i>commodity production</i> the conversion of the product into money, the sale, is a <i>conditio sine qua [non]</i>. Direct production for personal needs does not take place. Crisis results from the impossibility to sell. The difficulty of transforming the <i>commodity</i> \u2014 the particular product of individual labour \u2014 into its opposite, <i>money</i>, i.e. abstract general social labour, lies in the fact that <i>money</i> is not the particular product of individual labour, and that the person who has effected a sale, who therefore has commodities in the form of money, is not compelled to buy again at once, to transform the money again into a particular product of individual labour. In barter this contradiction does not exist: no one can be a seller without being a buyer or a buyer without being a seller. The difficulty of the seller \u2014 on the assumption that his commodity has use value \u2014 only stems from the ease with which the buyer can defer the retransformation of money into commodity. The difficulty of converting the commodity into money, of selling it, only arises from the fact that the commodity must be turned into money but the money need not be immediately turned into commodity, and therefore <i>sale</i> and <i>purchase</i> can be separated. We have said that this <i>form</i> contains the <i>possibility</i> of crisis, that is to say, the possibility that elements which are correlated, which are inseparable, are separated and consequently are forcibly reunited, their coherence is violently asserted against their mutual independence. <i>Crisis</i> is nothing but the forcible assertion of the unity of phases of the production process which have become independent of each other.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p33\"></a>The general, abstract possibility of crisis denotes no more than the <i>most abstract form</i> of crisis, without content, without a compelling motivating factor. Sale and purchase may fall apart. They thus represent <i>crisis</i> potentia and their coincidence always remains a critical factor for the commodity. The transition from one to the other may, however, proceed smoothly. The <i>most abstract form of crisis</i> (and therefore the formal possibility of crisis) is thus the <i>metamorphosis of the commodity</i> itself; the contradiction of exchange value and use value, and furthermore of money and commodity, comprised within the unity of the commodity, exists in metamorphosis only as an involved movement. The factors which turn this possibility of crisis into [an actual] crisis are not contained in this form itself; it only implies that <i>the</i> framework for a crisis exists.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p34\"></a>And in a consideration of the bourgeois economy, that is the important thing. The world trade crises must be regarded as the real concentration and forcible adjustment of all the contradictions of bourgeois economy. The individual factors, which are condensed in these crises, must therefore emerge and must be described in each sphere of the bourgeois economy and the further we advance in our examination of the latter, the more aspects of this conflict must be traced on the one hand, and on the other hand it must be shown that its more abstract forms are recurring and are contained in the more concrete forms.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p35\"></a>It can therefore be said that the crisis in its first form is the metamorphosis of the commodity itself, the falling asunder of purchase and sale.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p36\"></a>The crisis in its second form is the function of money as a means of payment, in which money has 2 different functions and figures in two different phases, divided from each other in time. Both these forms are as yet quite abstract, although the second is more concrete than the first.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p37\"></a>To begin with therefore, in considering the <i>reproduction process</i> of capital (which coincides with its circulation) it is necessary to prove that the above forms are simply repeated, or rather, that only here they receive a content, a basis on which to manifest themselves.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p38\"></a>Let us look at the movement of capital from the moment in which it leaves the production process as a commodity in order once again to emerge from it as a commodity. If we abstract here from all the other factors determining its content, then the total commodity capital and each individual commodity of which it is made up, must go through the process <i>C\u2014M\u2014C</i>, the metamorphosis of the commodity. The general possibility of crisis, which is contained in this form \u2014 the falling apart of purchase and sale \u2014 is thus contained in the movement of capital, in so far as the latter is <i>also</i> commodity and nothing but commodity. From the interconnection of the metamorphoses of commodities it follows, moreover, that one commodity is transformed into money because another is retransformed from the form of money into commodity. Furthermore, the separation of purchase and sale appears here in such a way that the transformation of one capital from the form of commodity into the form of money, must correspond to the retransformation of the other capital from the form of money into the form of commodity. The first metamorphosis of one capital [must correspond] to the second [metamorphosis] of the other; one capital leaves the production process as the other capital returns into the production process. This intertwining and coalescence of the processes of reproduction or circulation of different capitals is on the one hand necessitated by the division of labour, on the other hand it is accidental; and thus the definition of the content of crisis is already fuller.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p39\"></a>Secondly, however, with regard to the possibility of crisis arising from the form of money as <i>means of payment</i>, it appears that capital may provide a much more concrete basis for turning this possibility into reality. For example, the weaver must pay for the whole of the constant capital whose elements have been produced by the spinner, the flax-grower, the machine-builder, the iron and timber manufacturer, the producer of coal, etc. In so far as these latter produce constant capital that only enters into the production of constant capital, without entering into the cloth, the final commodity, they replace each other\u2019s means of production through the exchange of capital. Supposing the weaver now sells the cloth for \u00a31,000 to the <i>merchant</i> but in return for a bill of exchange so that money figures as <i>means of payment</i>. The weaver for his part hands over the bill of exchange to the <i>banker</i>, to whom he may thus be repaying a debt or, on the other hand, the banker may negotiate the bill for him. The flax-grower has sold to the spinner in return for a bill of exchange, the spinner to the weaver, the machine manufacturer to the weaver, the iron and timber manufacturer to the machine manufacturer, the coal producer to the spinner, weaver, machine manufacturer, iron and timber supplier. Besides, the iron, coal, timber and flax producers have paid one another with bills of exchange. Now if the merchant does not pay, then the weaver cannot pay his bill of exchange to the banker. The flax-grower has drawn on the spinner, the machine manufacturer on the weaver and the spinner. The spinner cannot pay because the weaver [can]not pay, neither of them pay the machine manufacturer, and the latter does not pay the iron, timber or coal supplier. And all of these in turn, as they cannot realise the value of their commodities, cannot replace that portion of value which is to replace their constant capital. Thus the general crisis comes into being. This is nothing other than the <i>possibility of crisis</i> described when dealing with money as a means of payment; but here \u2014 in capitalist production \u2014 we can already see the connection between the mutual claims and obligations, the sales and purchases, through which the possibility can develop into actuality.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p40\"></a>In any <i>case:</i> If purchase and sale do not get bogged down, and therefore do not require forcible adjustment \u2014 and, on the other hand, money as means of payment functions in such a way that claims are mutually settled, and thus the contradiction inherent in money as a means of payment is not realised \u2014 if therefore neither of these two abstract forms of crisis become real, no crisis exists. No crisis can exist unless sale and purchase are separated from one another and come into conflict, or the contradictions contained in money as a means of payment actually come into play; crisis, therefore, cannot exist without manifesting itself at the same time in its simple form, as the contradiction between sale and purchase and the contradiction of money as a means of payment. But these are merely <i>forms</i>, general possibilities of crisis, and hence also forms, abstract forms, of actual crisis. In them, the existence of crisis appears in its simplest forms, and, in so far as this form is itself the simplest content of crisis, in its simplest content. But the content is not yet <i>substantiated</i>. Simple circulation of money and even the circulation of money as a means of payment \u2014 and both come into being long <i>before</i> capitalist production, while there are no crises \u2014 are possible and actually take place without crises. These forms alone, therefore, do not explain why their crucial aspect becomes prominent and why the contradiction contained in them potentially becomes a real contradiction.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p41\"></a>This shows the economists\u2019 enormous <i>fadaise</i> [vulgarity, commonness], when they are no longer able to explain away the phenomenon of overproduction and crises, are content to say that these forms contain the possibility of crises, that it is therefore <i>accidental</i> whether or not crises occur and consequently their occurrence is itself merely a <i>matter of chance</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p42\"></a>The contradictions inherent in the circulation of commodities, which are further developed in the circulation of money \u2014 and thus, also, the possibilities of crisis \u2014 reproduce themselves, automatically, in capital, since developed circulation of commodities and of money, in fact, only takes place on the basis of capital.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p43\"></a>But now the further development of the potential <span class=\"eng\">crisis</span> has to be traced \u2014 the real crisis can only be educed from the real movement of capitalist production, competition and credit \u2014 in so far as crisis arises out of the special aspects of capital which are peculiar to it as capital, and not merely comprised in its existence as commodity and money.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p44\"></a>The mere (direct) <i>production process</i> of capital in itself, cannot add anything new in this context. In order to exist at all, its conditions are presupposed. The first section dealing with capital \u2014 the <i>direct</i> process of production \u2014 does not contribute any new element of crisis. Although it <i>does</i> contain such an element, because the production process implies appropriation and hence production of surplus value. But this cannot be shown when dealing with the production process itself, for the latter is not concerned with the realisation either of the reproduced value or of the surplus value.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p45\"></a>This can only emerge in the <i>circulation process</i> which is in itself also a <i>process of reproduction</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p46\"></a>Furthermore it is necessary to describe the circulation or reproduction process <i>before</i> dealing with the already existing capital \u2014 <i>capital and profit</i> \u2014 since we have to explain, not only how capital produces, but also how capital is produced. But the actual movement starts from the existing capital \u2014 i.e. the actual movement denotes developed capitalist production, which starts from and presupposes its own basis. The process of reproduction and the predisposition to crisis which is further developed in it, are therefore only partially described under this heading and require further elaboration in the chapter on \u201cCapital and Profit\u201d.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p47\"></a>The circulation process as a whole or the reproduction process of capital as a whole is the unity of its production phase and its circulation phase, so that it comprises both these processes or phases. Therein lies a further developed possibility or abstract form of crisis. The economists who deny crises consequently assert only the unity of these two phases. If they were only separate, without being a unity, then their unity could not be established by force and there could be no crisis. If they were only a unity without being separate, then no violent separation would be possible implying a crisis. Crisis is the forcible establishment of unity between elements that have become independent and the enforced separation from one another of elements which are essentially one.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p48\"></a>Therefore:</p>", "<p><a id=\"p49\"></a>1) The general <i>possibility</i> of crisis is given in the process of <i>metamorphosis of capital</i> itself, and in two ways: in so far as money functions as <i>means of circulation</i>, there is the separation <i>of purchase and sale</i>, and in so far as money functions as <i>means of payment</i>, it has two different aspects, it acts as <i>measure of value</i> and as <i>realisation of value</i>. These two aspects become separated. If in <i>the interval</i> between them the value has changed, if the commodity at the moment of its sale is not <i>worth</i> what it was <i>worth</i> at the moment when money was acting as a measure of value and therefore as a measure of the reciprocal obligations, then the obligation cannot be met from the <i>proceeds of the sale of the commodity</i>, and therefore the whole series of transactions which retrogressively depend on this one transaction, cannot be settled. If even for only <i>a limited period of time</i> the commodity cannot be sold then, although its value has not altered, <i>money</i> cannot function as <i>means of payment</i>, since it must function as such in a <i>definite given period of time</i>. But as the same sum of money acts for a whole series of reciprocal transactions and obligations here, <i>inability to pay</i> occurs not only at one, but at many points, hence a <i>crisis</i> arises.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p50\"></a>These are the <i>formal possibilities</i> of crisis. The form mentioned first is possible without the latter \u2014 that is to say, crises are possible without credit, without money functioning as a means of payment. But the second form is not possible without <i>the first</i> \u2014 that is to say, without the separation between purchase and sale. But in the latter case, the crisis occurs not only because the commodity is unsaleable, but because it is not saleable within a <i>particular period of time</i>, and the crisis arises and derives its character not only from the <i>unsaleability</i> of the commodity, but from the <i>non-fulfilment of a whole series of payments</i> which depend on the sale of this particular commodity within this particular period of time. This is the <i>actual</i> form of money crises.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p51\"></a>If the <i>crisis</i> appears, therefore, because purchase and sale become separated, it becomes a <i>money crisis</i>, as soon as money has developed as <i>means of payment</i>, and this <i>second form</i> of crisis follows as a matter of course, when the <i>first occurs</i>. In investigating why the general <i>possibility of crisis</i> becomes a reality, in investigating the <i>conditions</i> of crisis, it is therefore quite superfluous to concern oneself with the <i>forms</i> of crisis which arise out of the development of money as <i>means of payment</i>. This is precisely why economists like to suggest that this <i>obvious</i> form is the <i>cause</i> of crises. (In so far as the development of money as means of payment is linked with the development of credit and of <span class=\"eng\"><i>overcredit</i></span> the causes of the latter have to be examined, but this is not yet the place to do it.)</p>", "<p><a id=\"p52\"></a>2) In so far as crises arise from <i>changes in prices</i> and <i>revolutions in prices</i>, which do not coincide with <i>changes in the values</i> of commodities, they naturally cannot be investigated during the examination of capital in general, in which the prices of commodities are assumed to be <i>identical</i> with the <i>values</i> of commodities.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p53\"></a>3) The <i>general possibility</i> of crisis is the formal <i>metamorphosis</i> of capital itself, the separation, in time and space, of purchase and sale. But this is never the <i>cause</i> of the crisis. For it is nothing but the <i>most general form of crisis</i>, i.e. the crisis itself in <i>its most generalised expression</i>. But it cannot be said that the <i>abstract form of crisis</i> is <i>the cause of crisis</i>. If one asks what its cause is, one wants to know why <i>its abstract form</i>, the form of its possibility, turns from possibility into <i>actuality</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p54\"></a>4) The <i>general conditions</i> of crises, in so far as they are independent of <i>price fluctuations</i> (whether these are linked with the credit system or not) as distinct from fluctuations in value, must be explicable from the general conditions of capitalist production.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p55\"></a><i>First phase</i>. The <i>reconversion of money into capital</i>. A definite level of <i>production or reproduction</i> is assumed. Fixed capital can be regarded here as given, as remaining unchanged and not entering into the <i>valorisation process</i>. Since the reproduction of raw material is not dependent solely on the labour employed on it, but on the productivity of this labour which is bound up with <i>natural conditions</i>, it is possible for the volume, the <i>amount</i> of the product of <i>the same</i> quantity of labour, to fall (as a result of <span class=\"eng\">bad seasons</span>). <i>The value of the raw material therefore rises; its volume decreases</i>, in other words the <i>proportions</i> in which the money has to be reconverted into the <i>various component parts</i> of capital in order to continue production on the former scale, are upset. More must be expended on <i>raw material</i>, less remains for <i>labour</i>, and it is not possible to absorb the same quantity of labour as before. Firstly this is <i>physically impossible</i>, because of the deficiency in raw material. <i>Secondly</i>, it is impossible because a greater <i>portion of the value of the product</i> has to be converted into raw material, thus leaving less for conversion into <i>variable capital</i>. Reproduction cannot be <i>repeated</i> on the same scale. A part of <i>fixed capital</i> stands idle and a part of the workers is thrown out on the streets. The <i>rate of profit</i> falls because the value of constant capital has risen as against that of variable capital and less variable capital is employed. The fixed charges \u2014 interest, rent \u2014 which were based on the anticipation of a <i>constant</i> rate of profit and exploitation of labour, remain the same and in part <i>cannot be paid</i>. Hence <i>crisis</i>. Crisis of labour and crisis of capital. This is therefore a <i>disturbance in the reproduction process</i> due to the increase in the value of that part of constant capital which has to be replaced out of the value of the product. Moreover, although the <i>rate of profit</i> is decreasing, there is a <i>rise in the price of the product</i>. If this product enters into other spheres of production as a means of production, the <i>rise in</i> its <i>price</i> will result in the same <span class=\"eng\">derangement</span> in <i>reproduction</i> in these spheres. If it enters into general consumption as a means of subsistence, it either enters also <i>into the consumption of the workers</i> or <i>not</i>. If it does so, then its effects will be the same as those of a <span class=\"eng\">derangement</span> in <i>variable capital</i>, of which we shall speak later. But in so far as it enters into <i>general consumption</i> it <i>may</i> result (if its consumption is not reduced) in a diminished <i>demand</i> for other products and consequently <i>prevent their reconversion</i> into money at their value, thus disturbing the <i>other aspect</i> of their reproduction \u2014 not the <i>reconversion of money</i> into productive capital but the <i>reconversion</i> of commodities into money. In any case, the <i>volume of profits</i> and the <i>volume of wages</i> is reduced in this branch of production thereby reducing a <i>part of the necessary <span class=\"eng\">returns</span></i> from the sale of commodities from other branches of production.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p56\"></a>Such a <i>shortage of raw material</i> may, however, occur not only because of the <i>influence of <span class=\"eng\">seasons</span></i> or of the <i>natural productivity</i> of the labour which supplies the raw material. For if an <i>excessive portion</i> of the <i>surplus value</i>, <i>of the surplus capital</i>, is laid out in machinery, etc. in a particular branch of production, then, although the [raw] <span class=\"eng\">material</span> would have been sufficient for the <i>old level of production</i>, it will be insufficient for the <i>new</i>. This therefore arises from the <i><span class=\"eng\">disproportionate</span></i> conversion of <span class=\"eng\">surplus capital</span> into its various elements. It is a <span class=\"eng\">case</span> of <i>surplus production of fixed capital</i> and gives rise to exactly the same phenomena as occur in the first case. (See the previous page.)</p>", "<p><a id=\"p57\"></a>[39]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p58\"></a>Or they [the crises] are due to an <i>overproduction of fixed capital</i> and therefore a relative underproduction of circulating capital.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p59\"></a>Since <i>fixed capital</i>, like <i>circulating</i>, consists of commodities, it is quite ridiculous that the same economists who admit the <i>overproduction of fixed capital</i>, deny the <i>overproduction of commodities</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p60\"></a>5) <i>Crises arising from disturbances in the first phase of reproduction;</i> that is to say, interrupted conversion of commodities into money or <i>interruption of sale</i>. In the case of crises of the first sort the crisis arises from interruptions in the <i>flowing back</i> of the elements of productive capital.</p>", "<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p61\"></a>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"stea\"><b>***</b></span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>", "<p><a id=\"p62\"></a>The world <span class=\"eng\"><i>overproduction</i></span> in itself leads to error. So long as the most urgent needs of a large part of society are not satisfied, or <i>only</i> the most immediate needs are satisfied, there can of course be absolutely no talk of an <i>overproduction of products</i> \u2014 in the sense that the amount of products is excessive in relation to the need for them. On the contrary, it must be said that on the basis of capitalist production, there is constant <i>underproduction</i> in this sense. The limits to production are set by the profit of the capitalist and in no way by the needs of the producers. But overproduction of products and overproduction of <i>commodities</i> are two entirely different things. If Ricardo thinks that the <i>commodity</i> form makes no difference to the product, and furthermore, that <i>commodity circulation</i> differs only formally from barter, that in this context the exchange value is only a fleeting form of the exchange of things, and that money is therefore merely a formal means of circulation \u2014 then this in fact is in line with his presupposition that the bourgeois mode of production is the absolute mode of production, hence it is a mode of production without any definite specific characteristics, its distinctive traits are merely formal. He cannot therefore admit that the bourgeois mode of production contains within itself a barrier to the free development of the productive forces, a barrier which comes to the surface in crises and, in particular, in <i>overproduction</i> \u2014 the basic phenomenon in crises.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p63\"></a>Ricardo saw from the passages of Adam Smith, which he quotes, approves, and therefore also repeats, that the limitless <span class=\"eng\">\u201cdesire\u201d</span> for all kinds of use values is always satisfied on the basis of a state of affairs in which the mass of producers remains more or less restricted to necessities \u2014 <span class=\"eng\">\u201cfood\u201d</span> and other <span class=\"eng\">\u201cnecessaries\u201d</span> \u2014 that consequently this great majority of producers remains more or less excluded from the consumption of wealth \u2014 in so far as wealth goes beyond the bounds of the <span class=\"eng\">necessaries</span>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p64\"></a>This was indeed also the case, and to an even higher degree, in the ancient mode of production which depended on slavery. But the ancients never thought of transforming the <span class=\"eng\">surplus produce</span> into capital. Or at least only to a very limited extent. (The fact that the hoarding of treasure in the narrow sense was widespread among them shows how much <span class=\"eng\">surplus produce</span> lay completely idle.) They used a large part of the <span class=\"eng\">surplus produce</span> for unproductive expenditure on art, religious works and <i>travaux publics</i> [public works]. Still less was their production directed to the release and development of the material productive forces \u2014 division of labour, machinery, the application of the powers of nature and science to private production. In fact, by and large, they never went beyond handicraft labour. The wealth which they produced for private consumption was therefore relatively small and only appears great because it was amassed in the hands of a few persons, who, incidentally, did not know what to do with it. Although, therefore, there was no <i>overproduction</i> among the ancients, there was <i>overconsumption</i> by the rich, which in the final periods of Rome and Greece turned into mad extravagance. The few trading peoples among them lived partly at the expense of all these <i>essentiellement</i> poor nations. It is the unconditional development of the productive forces and therefore mass production on the basis of a mass of producers who are confined within the bounds of the necessaries on the one hand and, on the other, the barrier set up by the capitalists\u2019 profit, which [forms] the basis of modern overproduction.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p65\"></a>All the objections which Ricardo and others raise against overproduction, etc., rest on the fact that they regard bourgeois production either as a mode of production in which no distinction exists between purchase and sale \u2014 direct barter \u2014 or as <i>social</i> production, implying that society, as if according to a plan, distributes its means of production and productive forces in the degree and measure which is required for the fulfilment of the various social needs, so that each sphere of production receives the <i>quota</i> of social capital required to satisfy the corresponding need. This fiction arises entirely from the inability to grasp the specific form of bourgeois production and this inability in turn arises from the obsession that bourgeois production is production as such, just like a man who believes in a particular religion and sees it as the religion, and everything outside of it only as <i>false</i> religions.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p66\"></a>On the contrary, the question that has to be answered is: since, on the basis of capitalist production, everyone works for himself and a particular labour must at the same time appear as its opposite, as abstract general labour and in this form as social labour \u2014 how is it possible to achieve the necessary balance and interdependence of the various spheres of production, their dimensions and the proportions between them, except through the constant neutralisation of a constant disharmony? This is admitted by those who speak of adjustments through competition, for these adjustments always presuppose that there is something to adjust, and therefore that harmony is always only a result of the movement which neutralises the existing disharmony.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p67\"></a>That is why Ricardo admits that a <span class=\"eng\">glut</span> of certain commodities is possible. What is supposed to be <i>impossible</i> is only <span class=\"eng\">a simultaneous, general glut</span> in <span class=\"eng\">the market</span>. The possibility of overproduction in any particular sphere of production is therefore not denied. It is the <i>simultaneity</i> of this phenomenon for <i>all</i> spheres of production which is said to be impossible and therefore makes impossible [general] overproduction and thus a <span class=\"eng\">general glut</span> in <span class=\"eng\">the market</span> (this expression must always be taken <i>cum grano salis</i>, [Literally: with a grain of salt; figuratively: with skepticism.] since in times of general overproduction, the overproduction in some spheres is always only the <i>result</i>, the <i>consequence</i>, of overproduction in the leading articles of commerce; [it is] always only <i>relative</i>, i.e. overproduction because overproduction exists in other spheres).</p>", "<p><a id=\"p68\"></a>Apologetics turns this into its very opposite. [There is only] overproduction in the leading articles of commerce, in which alone, active overproduction shows itself \u2014 these are on the whole articles which can only be produced on a mass scale and by factory methods (also in agriculture), because overproduction exists in those articles in which relative or passive overproduction manifests itself. According to this, overproduction only exists because overproduction is not universal. The <i>relativity</i> of overproduction \u2014 that actual overproduction in a few spheres calls forth overproduction in others \u2014 is expressed in this way: There is no <i>universal</i> overproduction, because if overproduction were universal, all spheres of production would retain the same relation to one another; therefore <i>universal</i> overproduction = <span class=\"eng\">proportionate production</span> which excludes overproduction. And this is supposed to be an argument against universal overproduction. For, since universal overproduction in the absolute sense would not be overproduction but only a greater than usual development of the productive forces in all spheres of production, it is alleged that <i>actual overproduction</i>, which is precisely not this non-existent, self-abrogating overproduction, does <i>not</i> exist \u2014 although it only exists because it is not this.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p69\"></a>If this miserable sophistry is more closely examined, it amounts to this: Suppose, that there is overproduction in iron, cotton goods, <span class=\"eng\">linens, silks, woollens</span>, etc.; then it cannot be said, for example, that too little coal has been produced and that this is the reason for the above overproduction. For that overproduction of iron, etc. involves an exactly similar overproduction of coal, as, say, the overproduction of woven cloth does of yarn. //Overproduction of yarn as compared with cloth, iron as compared with machinery, etc. could occur. This would always be a relative overproduction of constant capital.// There cannot, therefore, be any question of the underproduction of those articles whose overproduction is implied because they enter as an element, raw material, <i>mati\u00e8re instrumentale</i> or means of production, into those articles (the <span class=\"eng\">\u201cparticular commodity of which too much may be produced, of which there may be such a glut in the market, as not to repay the capital expended on it\u201d</span>), whose positive overproduction is precisely the <span class=\"eng\">fact to be explained</span>. Rather, it is a question of other articles which belong directly to [other] spheres of production and [can] neither [be] subsumed under the leading articles of commerce which, according to the assumption, have been <span class=\"eng\">overproduced</span>, nor be attributed to spheres in which, because they supply the <i>intermediate product</i> for the leading articles of commerce, production must have reached at least the same level as in the final phases of the product \u2014 although there is nothing to prevent production in those spheres from having gone even further ahead thus causing an overproduction within the overproduction. For example, although sufficient coal must have been produced in order to keep going all those industries into which coal enters as necessary condition of production, and therefore the <i>overproduction</i> of coal is implied in the <i>overproduction</i> of iron, yarn, etc. (even if coal was produced only in proportion to the production of iron and yarn), it is <i>also</i> possible that more coal was produced than was required even for the overproduction of iron, yarn, etc. This is not only possible, but very probable. For the <i>production of coal and yarn</i> and of all other spheres of production which produce only the conditions or earlier phases of a product to be completed in another sphere, is governed not by the immediate demand, by the immediate production or reproduction, but by the <i>degree</i>, <i>measure</i>, <i>proportion</i> in which these are expanding. And it is <span class=\"eng\">self-evident</span> that in this calculation, the target may well be overshot. Thus not enough has been produced of other articles such as, for example, pianos, precious stones, etc., they have been <i>underproduced</i>. //There are, however, also cases where the overproduction of non-leading articles is not the result of overproduction, but where, on the contrary, <i>underproduction</i> is the cause of overproduction, as for instance when there has been a failure in the grain crop or the cotton crop, etc.//</p>", "<p><a id=\"p70\"></a>The absurdity of this statement becomes particularly marked if it is applied to the international scene, as it has been by Say and others after him. For instance, that England has not <i>overproduced</i> but Italy has <i>underproduced</i>. There would have been no overproduction, if Italy 1) had enough capital to replace the English capital exported to Italy in the form of commodities; 2) if Italy had invested this capital in such a way that it produced those particular articles which are required by English capital \u2014 partly in order to replace itself and partly in order to replace the <span class=\"eng\">revenue</span> yielded by it. Thus the fact of the actually existing overproduction in <i>England</i> \u2014 in relation to the <i>actual</i> production in Italy \u2014 would not have existed, but only the fact of <i>imaginary underproduction</i> in <i>Italy;</i> imaginary because it presupposes a capital in Italy and a development of the productive powers that does not exist there, and secondly because it makes the equally utopian assumption, that this capital which does <i>not</i> exist in Italy, has been employed in exactly the way required to make <span class=\"eng\">English supply and Italian demand</span>, English and Italian production, complementary to each other. In other words, this means nothing but: there would be no overproduction, if demand and supply corresponded to each other, if the capital were distributed in such proportions in all spheres of production, that the production of one article involved the consumption of the other, and thus its own consumption. There would be no overproduction, if there were no overproduction. Since, however, capitalist production can allow itself free rein only in certain spheres, under certain conditions, there could be no capitalist production at all if it had to develop <i>simultaneously</i> and <i>evenly</i> in all spheres. Because absolute overproduction takes place in certain spheres, relative overproduction occurs also in the spheres where there has been no overproduction.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p71\"></a>This explanation of overproduction in one field by underproduction in another field therefore means merely that if production were proportionate, there would be no overproduction. Ditto, if demand and supply corresponded to each other. Ditto, if all spheres provided equal opportunities for capitalist production and its expansion \u2014 division of labour, machinery, export to distant markets, etc., including mass production, if all countries which traded with one another possessed the same capacity for production (and indeed for different and complementary production). Thus overproduction takes place because all these pious wishes are not fulfilled. Or, in even more abstract form: There would be no overproduction in one place, if overproduction took place to the same extent everywhere. But there is not enough capital to overproduce so universally, and therefore there is [no] universal overproduction. Let us examine this fantasy more closely:</p>", "<p><a id=\"p72\"></a>It is admitted that there can be overproduction in each <i>particular <span class=\"eng\">trade</span></i>. The only circumstance which could prevent overproduction in <i>all</i> [trades] simultaneously is, according to the assertions made, the fact that commodity exchanges against commodity \u2014 i.e. <span class=\"eng\">recourse</span> [is taken] <span class=\"eng\">to the supposed</span> conditions <span class=\"eng\">of barter</span>. But this loop-hole is blocked by the very fact that <span class=\"eng\">trade</span> is not <span class=\"eng\">barter</span>, and that therefore the seller of a commodity is not necessarily <span class=\"eng\">at the same time the buyer of another</span>. This whole subterfuge then rests on abstracting from <i>money</i> and from the fact that we are not concerned with the exchange of products, but with the circulation of commodities, an essential part of which is the separation of purchase and sale.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p73\"></a>//The circulation of capital contains within itself the <i>possibilities</i> of interruptions. In the reconversion of money into its conditions of production, for example, it is not only a question of transforming money into the same use values (in kind), but for the repetition of the reproduction process [it is] essential that these use values can again be obtained at their old value (at a lower value would of course be even better). A very significant part of these elements of reproduction, which consists of raw materials, can however rise in price for two reasons: <i>Firstly</i>, if the instruments of production increase more rapidly than the amount of raw materials that can be provided at <span class=\"eng\">the given time</span>. <i>Secondly</i>, as a result of the variable character of the <span class=\"eng\">seasons</span>. That is why weather conditions, as Tooke rightly observes, play such an important part in modern industry. [Th. Tooke, <i>A History of Prices, and of the State of the Circulation, from 1839 to 1847 Inclusive...</i>, London, 1848, pp. 3-35.] (The same applies to the means of subsistence in relation to wages.) The reconversion of money into commodity can thus come up against difficulties and can create the possibilities of crisis, just as well as can the conversion of commodity into money. When one examines simple circulation \u2014 not the circulation of capital \u2014 these difficulties do not arise.// (There are, besides, a large number of other factors \u2014 conditions, possibilities of crises, which can only be examined when considering the concrete conditions, particularly the competition of capitals and credit.)</p>", "<p><a id=\"p74\"></a>The <i>overproduction of commodities</i> is denied but the <i>overproduction of capital</i> is admitted. Capital itself however consists of commodities or, in so far as it consists of money, it must be reconverted, into commodities <i>d\u2019une mani\u00e8re ou d\u2019une autre</i> [of one kind or another], in order to be able to function as capital. What then does <i>overproduction of capital</i> means? Overproduction of amounts of value destined to produce surplus value (or, if one considers the material content, overproduction of commodities destined for reproduction) \u2014 that is, <i>reproduction on too large a scale</i>, which is the same as overproduction pure and simple.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p75\"></a>Defined more closely, this means nothing more than that too much has been produced for the purpose of <i>enrichment</i>, or that too great a part of the product is intended not for consumption as <span class=\"eng\">revenue</span>, but <i>for making more money</i> (for accumulation); not to satisfy the personal needs of its owner, but to give him money, abstract social riches and capital, more power over the labour of others, i.e. to increase this power. This is what one side says. (Ricardo denies it.) And the other side, how does it explain the overproduction of commodities? By saying that production <span class=\"eng\">is not diversified enough</span>, that certain articles of consumption have not been produced in sufficiently large quantities. That it is not a matter of industrial consumption is obvious, for the manufacturer who overproduces linen, thereby necessarily increases his demand for yarn, machinery, labour, etc. It is therefore a question of personal consumption. Too much linen has been produced, but perhaps too few oranges. Previously the existence of money was denied, in order to show [that there was no] separation between sale and purchase. Here the existence of capital is denied, in order to transform the capitalists into people who carry out the simple operation <i>C\u2014M\u2014C</i> and who produce for individual consumption and not <i>as</i> capitalists with the aim of enrichment, i.e. the reconversion of part of the surplus value into capital. But the statement that there is <i>too much capital</i>, after all means merely that too little is consumed as <span class=\"eng\"><i>revenue</i></span>, and that more cannot be consumed in the given conditions. (<i>Sismondi</i>.) Why does the producer of linen demand from the producer of corn, that he should consume more linen, or the latter demand that the linen manufacturer should consume more corn? Why does the man who produces linen not himself convert a larger part of his <span class=\"eng\">revenue</span> (surplus value) into linen and the <span class=\"eng\">farmer</span> into corn? So far as each individual is concerned, it will be admitted that his desire for capitalisation (apart from the limits of his needs) prevents him from doing this. But for all of them collectively, this is not admitted.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p76\"></a>(We are entirely leaving out of account here that element of crises which arises from the fact that commodities are reproduced more cheaply than they were produced. <span class=\"eng\">Hence</span> the depreciation of the commodities on the market.)</p>", "<p><a id=\"p77\"></a>In world market crises, all the contradictions of bourgeois production erupt collectively; in particular crises <i>(particular</i> in their content and in extent) the eruptions are only sporadical, isolated and one-sided.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p78\"></a><i>Overproduction</i> is specifically conditioned by the general law of the production of capital: to produce to the limit set by the productive forces (that is to say, to exploit the maximum amount of labour with the given amount of capital), without any consideration for the actual limits of the market or the needs backed by the ability to pay; and this is carried out through continuous expansion of reproduction and accumulation, and therefore constant reconversion of <span class=\"eng\">revenue</span> into capital, while on the other hand, the mass of the producers remain tied to the <span class=\"eng\">average</span> level of needs, and must remain tied to it according to the nature of capitalist production.</p>"], "year": "1863", "sourceBook": "Theories of Surplus Value", "author": "Marx", "title": "", "image": "marx", "info": "Marx (1863): Theories of Surplus Value", "idChr": "2.10text"}, {"content": ["<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p0\"></a>Supply, Demand and Value</h6>", "<p><a id=\"p1\"></a>Everyone knows that when supply and demand are evenly balanced, the relative value of any product is accurately determined by the quantity of labour embodied in it, that is to say, that this relative value expresses the proportional relation precisely in the sense we have just attached to it. M. Proudhon inverts the order of things. Begin, he says, by measuring the relative value of a product by the quantity of labour embodied in it, and supply and demand will infallibly balance one another. Production will correspond to consumption, the product will always be exchangeable. Its current price will express exactly its true value. Instead of saying like everyone else: when the weather is fine, a lot of people are to be seen going out for a walk, M. Proudhon makes his people go out for a walk in order to be able to ensure them fine weather.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p2\"></a>What M. Proudhon gives as the consequence of marketable value determined <i>a priori</i> by labour time could be justified only by a law couched more or less in the following terms:</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>Products will in future be exchanged in the exact ratio of the labour time they have cost. Whatever may be the proportion of supply to demand, the exchange of commodities will always be made as if they had been produced proportionately to the demand. Let M. Proudhon take it upon himself to formulate and lay down such a law, and we shall relieve him of the necessity of giving proofs. If, on the other hand, he insists on justifying his theory, not as a legislator, but as an economist, he will have to prove that the <i>time</i> needed to create a commodity indicates exactly the degree of its <i>utility</i> and marks its proportional relation to the demand, and in consequence, to the total amount of wealth. In this case, if a product is sold at a price equal to its cost of production, supply and demand will always be evenly balanced; for the cost of production is supposed to express the true relation between supply and demand.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>Actually, M. Proudhon sets out to prove that the labour time needed to create a product indicates its correct proportional relation to needs, so that the things whose production costs the least time are the most immediately useful, and so on, step by step. The mere production of a luxury object proves at once, according to this doctrine, that society has spare time which allows it to satisfy a need for luxury.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>M. Proudhon finds the very proof of his thesis in the observation that the most useful things cost the least time to produce, that society always begins with the easiest industries and successively \u201cstarts on the production of objects which cost more labour time and which correspond to a higher order of needs\u201d.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>M. Proudhon borrows from M. Dunoyer the example of extractive industry \u2014 fruit-gathering, pasturage, hunting, fishing, etc. \u2014 which is the simplest, the least costly of industries, and the one by which man began \u201cthe first day of his second creation\u201d. The first day of his first creation is recorded in Genesis, which shows us God as the world\u2019s first manufacturer.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>Things happen in quite a different way from what M. Proudhon imagines. The very moment civilisation begins, production begins to be founded on the antagonism of orders, estates, classes, and finally on the antagonism of accumulated labour and immediate labour. No antagonism, no progress. This is the law that civilisation has followed up to our days. Till now the productive forces have been developed by virtue of this system of class antagonisms. To say now that, because all the needs of all the workers were satisfied, men could devote themselves to the creation of products of a higher order \u2014 to more complicated industries \u2014 would be to leave class antagonism out of account and turn all historical development upside down. It is like saying that because, under the Roman emperors, muraena were fattened in artificial fishponds, therefore there was enough to feed abundantly the whole Roman population. Actually, on the contrary, the Roman people had not enough to buy bread with, while the Roman aristocrats had slaves enough to throw as fodder to the muraena.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>The price of food has almost continuously risen, while the price of manufactured and luxury goods has almost continuously fallen. Take the agricultural industry itself: the most indispensable objects, like corn, meat, etc., rise in price, while cotton, sugar, coffee, etc., continually fall in a surprising proportion. And even among comestibles proper, the luxury articles, like artichokes, asparagus, etc., are today relatively cheaper than foodstuffs of prime necessity. In our age, the superfluous is easier to produce than the necessary. Finally, at different historical epochs, the reciprocal price relations are not only different, but opposed to one another. In the whole of the Middle Ages, agricultural products were relatively cheaper than manufactured products; in modern times they are in inverse ratio. Does this mean that the utility of agricultural products has diminished since the Middle Ages?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>The use of products is determined by the social conditions in which the consumers find themselves placed, and these conditions themselves are based on class antagonism.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p10\"></a>Cotton, potatoes and spirits are objects of the most common use. Potatoes have engendered scrofula; cotton has to a great extent driven out flax and wool, although wool and flax are, in many cases, of greater utility, if only from the point of view of hygiene; finally, spirits have got the upper hand of beer and wine, although spirits used as an alimentary substance are everywhere recognised to be poison. For a whole century, governments struggled in vain against the European opium; economics prevailed, and dictated its orders to consumption.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p11\"></a>Why are cotton, potatoes and spirits the pivots of bourgeois society? Because the least amount of labour is needed to produce them, and, consequently, they have the lowest price. Why does the minimum price determine the maximum consumption? Is it by any chance because of the absolute utility of these objects, their intrinsic utility, their utility insomuch as they correspond, in the most useful manner, to the needs of the worker as a man, and not of the man as a worker? No, it is because in a society founded on poverty the poorest products have the fatal prerogative of being used by the greatest number.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p12\"></a>To say now that because the least costly things are in greater use, they must be of greater utility, is saying that the wide use of spirits, because of their low cost of production, is the most conclusive proof of their utility; it is telling the proletarian that potatoes are more wholesome for him than meat; it is accepting the present state of affairs; it is, in short, making an apology, with M. Proudhon, for a society without understanding it.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p13\"></a>In a future society, in which class antagonism will have ceased, in which there will no longer be any classes, use will no longer be determined by the <i>minimum</i> time of production; but the time of production devoted to an article will be determined by the degree of its social utility.</p>"], "year": "1847", "sourceBook": "The Poverty of Philosophy", "author": "Marx", "title": "Supply, Demand and Value", "image": "marxy", "info": "Marx (1847): The Poverty of Philosophy", "idChr": "2.11.01text"}, {"content": ["<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p0\"></a>Proving the Theory of Value</h6>", "<p class=\"mid\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p1\"></a>Marx to Ludwig Kugelmann</p>", "<p class=\"right\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a id=\"p2\"></a>11 July 1868</p>", "<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p3\"></a>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"stea\"><b>***</b></span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>As for the <i>Centralblatt</i>, the man is making the greatest concession possible by admitting that, if value means anything at all, then my conclusions must be conceded.

The chatter about the need to prove the concept of value arises only from complete ignorance both of the subject under discussion and of the method of science. Every child knows that any nation that stopped working, not for a year, but let us say, just for a few weeks, would perish. And every child knows, too, that the amounts of products corresponding to the differing amounts of needs demand differing and quantitatively determined amounts of society\u2019s aggregate labour. It is <span class=\"eng\">self-evident</span> that this <i>necessity</i> of the <i>distribution</i> of social labour in specific proportions is certainly not abolished by the <i>specific form</i> of social production; it can only change <i>its form of manifestation</i>. Natural laws cannot be abolished at all. The only thing that can change, under historically differing conditions, is the <i>form</i> in which those laws assert themselves. And the form in which this proportional distribution of labour asserts itself in a state of society in which the interconnection of social labour expresses itself as the <i>private exchange</i> of the individual products of labour, is precisely the <i>exchange value</i> of these products.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>Where science comes in is to show how the law of value asserts itself. So, if one wanted to \u2018explain\u2019 from the outset all phenomena that apparently contradict the law, one would have to provide the science <i>before</i> the science.

Russia and the United States of all places are missing here. It was the time when Russia constituted the last great reserve of all European reaction, when the United States absorbed the surplus proletarian forces of Europe through emigration. Both countries supplied Europe with raw materials and were at the same time markets for its industrial products. At that time both were, therefore, in one way or another, pillars of the existing European order.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>How very different today! It was precisely European immigration that enabled North America to attain gigantic agricultural production, competition from which is shaking the very foundations of European landed property \u2014 large and small. Moreover, it enabled the United States to exploit its tremendous industrial resources with an energy and on a scale that must shortly break the prevailing industrial monopoly of Western Europe, and especially of England. Both circumstances react in revolutionary manner upon America itself. Step by step the smaller and middle landownership of the farmers, the basis of the whole political constitution, is succumbing to the competition of giant farms; simultaneously, a numerous proletariat and a fabulous concentration of capital are developing for the first time in the industrial regions.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>And now Russia!

Now the question is: can the Russian <i>obshchina</i>, a form of primeval common ownership of land, even if greatly undermined, pass directly to the higher form of communist common ownership?

And, by the way, who but our enemies could take alarm at the authority of the General Council? Has it a bureaucracy and an armed police to ensure that it is obeyed? Is not its authority solely moral, and does it not submit its decisions to the Federations which have to carry them out?

But both the General Association of German Workers and the Social-Democratic Workers\u2019 Party together still form only a very small minority of the German working class. Our view, which we have found confirmed by long practice, is that the correct tactics in propaganda are not to entice away a few individuals and memberships here and there from one\u2019s opponent, but to work on the great mass, which is as yet uninvolved. The force of a single individual whom one has oneself reared from the raw is worth more than ten Lassallean defectors, who always bring the germ of their false tendencies into the Party with them. And if one could only get the masses without the <i>local leaders</i> it would still be all right. But one always has to take along a whole crowd of these leaders into the bargain, who are bound by their earlier public utterances, if not by their views hitherto, and now must prove above all things that they have not deserted their principles but that, on the contrary, the Social-Democratic Workers\u2019 Party preaches <i>true</i> Lassalleanism. This was the unfortunate thing at Eisenach, which could not be avoided at that time, perhaps, but there is no doubt at all that these elements have done harm to the Party and I am not sure that the Party would not be at least as strong today without that accession.

Especially for a party like ours, whose ultimate success is so absolutely certain and which has developed so enormously in our own lifetimes and before our own eyes, momentary success is by no means always and absolutely necessary. Take the International for instance. After the Commune it had a colossal success. The bourgeois, struck all of a heap, ascribed omnipotence to it. The great mass of the members believed things would stay like that for all eternity. We knew very well that the bubble <i>must</i> burst. All the riff-raff attached themselves to it. The sectarians within it became arrogant and misused the International in the hope that the most stupid and meanest actions would be permitted them. We did not allow that. Knowing well that the bubble must burst some time, our concern was not to delay the catastrophe but to take care that the International emerged from it pure and unadulterated. The bubble burst at The Hague and you know that the majority of the Congress members went home sick with disappointment. And yet nearly all these disappointed people, who imagined they would find the ideal of universal brotherhood and reconciliation in the International, had far more bitter quarrels at home than those which broke out at The Hague. Now the sectarian quarrelmongers are preaching reconciliation and decrying us as being quarrelsome and dictators. And if we had come out in a conciliatory way at The Hague, if we had hushed up the breaking out of the split \u2014 what would have been the result? The sectarians, especially the Bakuninists, would have got another year in which to perpetrate in the name of the International even far greater stupidities and infamies; the workers of the most developed countries would have turned away in disgust; the bubble would not have burst but, pierced by pinpricks, would have slowly collapsed, and the next Congress, which would have been bound to bring the crisis anyhow, would have turned into a row among the lowest kind of people, because <i>principles</i> would already have been sacrificed at The Hague. Then the International would indeed have gone to pieces \u2014 gone to pieces through \u2018unity\u2019! Instead of this we have now got rid of the rotten elements with honour to ourselves \u2014 the members of the Commune who were present at the last and decisive session say that no session of the Commune left such an excruciating impression upon them as this session of the tribunal which passed judgment on the traitors to the European proletariat. For ten months we let them expend all their energies on lies, slander and intrigue \u2014 and where are they? They, the alleged representatives of the great majority of the International, now themselves announce that they do not dare to come to the next Congress.

In the same year, they appeared in Hottingen-Zurich as a separate pamphlet entitled <i>Aufhebung des Sozialistengesetzes?

In my view it would be perfectly in order to point out to these people \u2014 and it was exclusively against them that the article was levelled \u2014 that a <i>voluntary</i> repeal of the Anti-Socialist Law might very easily be accompanied by conditions that aggravated the position of the <i>party;</i> to emphasise that the last way we shall rid ourselves of the Anti-Socialist Law is by begging and cringing.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>Otherwise the question is an academic one so far as I am concerned.

Otherwise I should have detected, from the way he visualises revolution, the French influence and hence also, no doubt, my Vollmar. Your handling of this aspect has been absolutely right. [Engels is referring to August Bebel\u2019s article \u2018Aufhebung des Sozialistengesetzes?\u2019 in <i>Der Sozialdemokrat</i>, No. 42, 12 October 1882, directed against two Vollmar\u2019s articles printed in <i>Der Sozialdemokrat</i> and as a separate pamphlet. Bebel\u2019s critique was spearheaded mostly against Vollmar\u2019s second article, in which the author advocated putsch tactics and a secret organisation of the party. Bebel denounced these tactics as unacceptable and even fatal for the party. In a letter to Engels of 1 October 1882, he explained that the imprudent language and tone of the articles like those by Vollmar could well entail unnecessary losses in the party.] It is the longed-for, ultimate realisation of the phrase \u2018single reactionary mass\u2019. [Lassalle\u2019s tenet that, with respect to the proletariat, all the other classes were \u2018one reactionary mass\u2019 was incorporated in the programme of the Social-Democratic Party of Germany approved at the Gotha Congress. For a criticism of this tenet, see Marx\u2019s work \u2018Critique of the Gotha Programme\u2019. In this letter, Engels uses the phrase \u2018single reactionary mass\u2019.] Here all the official parties combined in a lump, <i>there</i> we socialists in column; a great decisive battle, victory at one stroke all along the line. Things aren\u2019t that easy in reality. In reality, as you indeed point out, a revolution begins the other way round, in that the great majority of the people, as also of the official parties, band together <i>against</i> the government thus isolated and overthrow it and only after such of the official parties as still remain viable have reciprocally, collectively and successively brought about their own ruin, only then will Vollmar\u2019s great parting of the ways come about and with it our opportunity to rule.

So if I have made too light of this passage you, or so it seems to me, have taken it too seriously; you will have seen from Viereck\u2019s jubilations in the <i>S\u00fcddeutsche Post</i> how the right wing is seeking to make capital out of your reply. [After Bebel\u2019s critique of Vollmar\u2019s articles published as a separate pamphlet under the pen-name \u2018Surtur\u2019, the Right-wing Social Democrat Louis Viereck stated in his newspaper <i>S\u00fcddeutsche Post</i> that the pamphlet did not express the opinion of the party. <i>Der Sozialdemokrat</i> (No. 44, 26 October 1882) protested at Viereck\u2019s statement, stressing that the articles comprising the pamphlet were written by a party member and originally published by the party\u2019s printed organ.] I don\u2019t believe our people in Germany would have accepted Vollmar\u2019s way of talking simply on the strength of his articles, though the proclamation he has called for, \u2018We are organising <i>in secret\u2019</i>, certainly deserves to be rejected.</p>", "<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p7\"></a>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"stea\"><b>***</b></span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>In France the long-expected split has occurred.

The point at issue is purely one of principle: ought the struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie to be waged as a <i>class struggle</i>, or ought it to be conceded that, in good opportunist (or Possibilist, as the socialist translation has it) fashion, the programme and the movement\u2019s class character be dropped wherever this would enable more votes or more \u2018supporters\u2019 to be won? Malon and Brousse have come out in favour of the latter, thereby sacrificing the proletarian class character of the movement and making a division inevitable. Well and good. The development of the proletariat takes place everywhere to the accompaniment of internal struggles, and France, which is presently forming a workers\u2019 party for the first time, is no exception. We in Germany have passed beyond the first phase of the internal struggle (with the Lassalleans) and others still lie ahead of us. Unification is perfectly all right provided it works, but there are things which take precedence over unification.

Malicious insinuations are, of course, made about anything and everything, but by and large the impression gained by our opponents was nevertheless one of utter stupefaction at this ruthless self-criticism, stupefaction combined with the feeling that a party must be possessed of great inner strength if it could treat itself to that sort of thing. This much is apparent from the opposition newspapers I have been getting from you (very many thanks) and elsewhere. And I frankly admit that this was what I had in mind when I published the document. That it was bound at first to give grave offence in certain quarters I was aware, but it couldn\u2019t be helped and in my view this consideration was more than outweighed by its factual content. And I knew that the party was amply strong enough to stand it and I reckoned that today it would even <i>tolerate</i> the forthright language used 15 years ago, that it would point with justifiable pride to this test of its strength and say: Show us another party that would dare do the same.

Accordingly I consider the main responsibility to be mine. As to details, one can of course always hold differing views about such things. I deleted or altered everything that you and Dietz took exception to and, even if Dietz had made more deletions, I should still have been <i>coulant</i> [compliant] wherever possible; at no time have I failed to give the two of you proof of this. As to the main issue, however, it was <i>my duty</i> to publish the thing the moment the programme came up for discussion. And especially after Liebknecht\u2019s speech at Halle, in which he coolly quotes parts of it as though they were his own, while contesting others without naming their source, Marx would unquestionably have confronted this version with the original and in place of him I was duty bound to do the same. Unfortunately the document was not immediately to hand and I only found it much later after a long search.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>You mention that Bebel has written to you saying that Marx\u2019s treatment of Lassalle has caused bad blood amongst the old Lassalleans. That may be. Those people don\u2019t, of course, know the true story and nobody seems to have done anything to enlighten them on the subject. If they don\u2019t know that Lassalle\u2019s reputation as a great man is solely attributable to the fact that for years Marx allowed him to flaunt as his own the fruits of Marx\u2019s research and, what\u2019s more, to distort them because of his inadequate grounding in political economy, that is no fault of mine. But I am Marx\u2019s literary executor and as such I also have my obligations.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>For the past 26 years Lassalle has been part of history. If, while the Exceptional Law was in force, he has been exempt from historical criticism, it is now high time that such criticism came into its own and that light be thrown on Lassalle\u2019s position in regard to Marx. The legend which veils the true image of Lassalle and deifies him cannot, after all, become an article of faith for the party. However highly one may rate Lassalle\u2019s services on behalf of the movement, his historical role inside it remains an equivocal one. Everywhere Lassalle the socialist goes hand in hand with Lassalle the demagogue. In Lassalle the agitator and organiser, the Lassalle who conducted the Hatzfeldt lawsuit is everywhere apparent: the same cynicism in the choice of methods, the same predilection for consorting with corrupt and shady people who may be used simply as tools and then be discarded. Up till 1862 a specifically Prussian vulgar democrat in practice with marked Bonapartist tendencies (I have just been looking through his letters to Marx), he made a sudden volte-face for purely personal reasons and began to engage in agitation. And before 2 years had gone by he was demanding that the workers side with the monarchy against the bourgeoisie and had begun intriguing with his kindred spirit Bismarck in a manner that could only have led to the actual betrayal of the movement had he not, luckily for him, been shot in the nick of time. In his propagandist writings the correct arguments he borrowed from Marx are so interwoven with his own invariably false ones that it is virtually impossible to separate the two. Such workers as have been offended by Marx\u2019s judgment know nothing of Lassalle save for his 2 years of agitation and, furthermore, see the latter only through rose-tinted spectacles. But historical criticism cannot forever remain standing hat in hand before such prejudices. It was my duty to settle accounts once and for all between Marx and Lassalle. That has been done. With this I can content myself for the time being. Besides, I have other things to do. And the publication of Marx\u2019s ruthless judgment of Lassalle will undoubtedly prove effective on its own and put heart into others. But if I were forced to do so, there\u2019d be no alternative: I should have to dispose of the Lassallean legend once and for all.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>That voices should have been raised in the parliamentary group demanding that the <i>Neue Zeit</i> be subject to censorship is truly delectable.

The congress took place not in Zurich (the Zurich cantonal council forbade it), but in Chur between 2 and 4 October 1881. It was attended by delegates of socialist parties from 12 countries. The congress decided against forming a new International.

But the said question, being posed <i>out of the blue</i>, in fact poses a fallacious problem to which the only answer can be a <i>critique of the question</i> as such. We cannot solve an equation that does not comprise within its terms the elements of its solution.

(You will also find payment of this kind among the transitional measures in the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>.) This view owes its origin to the bourgeois economists; it was first advanced (if we disregard a similar postulate in the late 18th century) by the earliest radical disciples of Ricardo immediately after the latter\u2019s death. In 1847, in my anti-Proudhon book, I commented on it thus: <i>\u2018We understand such economists as Mill\u2019</i> (senior, not his son John Stuart who repeats the same thing in somewhat modified form), <i>\u2018Cherbuliez, Hilditch and others demanding that rent should be handed over to the State to serve in place of taxes.

This was instituted by the feudal law of England, France, Germany and other West European countries in the 11th-13th centuries with the aim of keeping landed estates intact and preventing their fragmentation among many heirs. Only the eldest son was eligible to inherit.] and other feudal relics, of bureaucracy, protective tariffs, and Anti-Socialist Law and restrictions on the right of assembly and of association. If our German Party of Progress [The Party of Progress, founded in June 1861, advocated the unification of Germany under the aegis of Prussia, the convocation of an all-German parliament, and a liberal Ministry responsible to the Chamber of Deputies. Fearing a popular revolution, it did not support the basic democratic demands \u2014 universal suffrage and the freedom of the press, association and assembly. In 1866 the Party of Progress split. Its right wing founded the National Liberal Party, which capitulated to the Bismarck government. After the final unification of Germany in 1871, the Progressists continued to describe themselves as an opposition party, but their opposition was purely declaratory. In March 1884 they merged with the left wing of the National Liberals to form the German Free-Thinking Party <i>(Die Deutsche Freisinntge Partei)</i>.] or your Danish Venstre were genuine radical-bourgeois parties and not just a miserable bunch of windbags who creep into their holes at the first threat uttered by Bismarck or Estrup, I would by no means <i>unreservedly</i> reject any kind of temporary collaboration with them having a specific end in view. When our deputies vote for a motion tabled by a different party \u2014 as they all too often have to do \u2014 even this could be described as a form of collaboration. But I would be in favour of it only if its immediate advantage to ourselves or to the country\u2019s historical progress towards economic and political revolution was instantly apparent and worth the effort. And provided the proletarian class character of the party were not jeopardised thereby. Thus far and no further I am prepared to go.

It exposes us to the dangers of corruption, or so say the anarchists and friend Morris. Very well, if the working class is an assortment of blockheads and weaklings and downright venal blackguards, then we might as well pack up at once, for in that case neither the proletariat nor any of the rest of us would have any business to be in the political arena at all. Like all other parties, the proletariat will be best taught by its own mistakes, and from those mistakes no one can wholly save it.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>In my opinion, therefore, you are wrong when you elevate what is primarily a question of tactics to the level of a question of principle. And so far as I\u2019m concerned, the only question that confronts us at the start is a tactical one. A tactical error, however, may in certain circumstances, lead to an infringement of principle.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p10\"></a>And here, so far as I can judge, you are right in criticising the tactics of the <i>Hovedhestyrelsen</i>. For years the Danish Left has been acting out an undignified comedy of opposition, nor does it ever tire of demonstrating its own impotence to the world at large. It has long since missed the opportunity \u2014 if ever it had one \u2014 of avenging the infringement of the Constitution by force or arms; indeed, an ever increasing proportion of the Left would seem to be yearning for reconciliation with Estrup. A genuinely proletarian party could not, or so it seems to me, collaborate with a party of that kind without in the long run forfeiting its class character as a working men\u2019s party. Hence, in so far as you stress the class character of the movement as arguing against this policy, I can only agree with you.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p11\"></a>Now as regards the methods adopted towards you and your friends by the <i>Hovedbestyrelsen</i>, such summary expulsion of an opposition from the party certainly occurred in the secret societies of 1840-51; the very secrecy of the organisation made this inevitable. It also occurred \u2014 not infrequently \u2014 among the English <i>Physical Force</i> Chartists under the dictatorship of O\u2019Connor. But the Chartists, being a party specifically organised for the use of force as their very name implies, were subject to dictatorship, and expulsion was an act of military discipline. On the other hand I have heard of no such high handed procedure in time of peace save in the case of the Lassalleans in J. B. von Schweitzer\u2019s \u2018rigid organisation\u2019; von Schweitzer had to make use of it because of his suspect dealings with the Berlin police, and in doing so only precipitated the disorganisation of the General German Workers\u2019 Association. It would be most unlikely to occur to any of the socialist labour parties presently in existence \u2014 now that Mr Rosenberg has happily made himself scarce in America \u2014 to treat along Danish lines an opposition it had nurtured in its own bosom. No party can live and prosper unless moderate and extreme tendencies grow up and even combat one another within its ranks, and one which expels the more extreme tendencies out of hand will merely promote their growth. The labour movement depends on mercilessly criticising existing society, criticism is the breath of life to it, so how can it itself avoid being criticised or try and forbid discussion?

Well, after the abolition of the Anti-Socialist Law, there would be no real objection to that. The party is so big that complete freedom of discussion within its ranks is imperative. Otherwise the many new elements who have joined it during the past 3 years and who are in some cases still exceedingly green and unpolished, could not be assimilated and trained. An accretion of 700,000 in 3 years (only counting the voters) isn\u2019t like a bunch of schoolboys into whom you can drum things; discussion and a certain amount of dissension is necessary and will help them over the first hurdle. There\u2019s not the slightest danger of a split; the press, now 12 years old, will take care of that. But these insolent literary men, bent on satisfying their colossal vanity, are intriguing and forming cliques for all they are worth, thereby arousing far more wrath than they warrant among the party leaders for whom they create a great deal of unaccustomed trouble and vexation. Hence the latter\u2019s conduct of the battle has been anything but skilful; Liebknecht is constantly on the warpath with his \u2018expulsions\u2019 and even Bebel, usually so tactful, has been stung by anger into publishing a somewhat foolish letter.

I shall probably be seeing Bebel, and Liebknecht over here before the congress, and shall do my utmost to convince them of the imprudence of any expulsion that rests not on convincing proof of <i>activities</i> harmful to the party but solely on charges of opposition-mongering. The biggest party in the empire cannot remain in existence unless every shade of opinion is allowed complete freedom of expression, while even the <i>semblance</i> of dictatorship <i>\u00e0 la</i> Schweitzer must be avoided.

However, they denounced the abyss. Beneath the apparently solid surface, they betrayed oceans of liquid matter, only needing expansion to rend into fragments continents of hard rock. Noisily and confusediv they proclaimed the emancipation of the Proletarian, <i>i.e.</i> the secret of the 19th century, and of the revolution of that century. That social revolution, it is true, was no novelty invented in 1848. Steam, electricity, and the self-acting mule were revolutionists of a rather more dangerous character than even citizens Barb\u00e8s, Raspail and Blanqui. But, although the atmosphere in which we live, weighs upon every one with a 20,000 lb. force, do you feel it? No more than European society before 1848 felt the revolutionary atmosphere enveloping and pressing it from all sides. There is one great fact, characteristic of this our 19th centurv, a fact which no party dares deny. On the one hand, there have started into life industrial and scientific forces, which no epoch of the former human history had ever suspected. On the other hand, there exist symptoms of decay, far surpassing the horrors recorded of the latter times of the Roman Empire. In our days, everything seems pregnant with its contrary. Machinery, gifted with the wonderful power of shortening and fructifying human labour, we behold starving and overworking it. The new-fangled sources of wealth, by some strange weird spell, are turned into sources of want. The victories of art seem bought by the loss of character. At the same pace that mankind masters nature, man seems to become enslaved to other men or to his own infamy. Even the pure light of science seems unable to shine but on the dark background of ignorance. All our invention and progress seem to result in endowing material forces with intellectual life, and in stultifying human life into a material force. This antagonism between modern industry and science on the one hand, modern misery and dissolution on the other hand; this antagonism between the productive powers and the social relations of our epoch is a fact, palpable, overwhelming, and not to be controverted. Some parties may wail over it; others may wish to get rid of modern arts, in order to get rid of modern conflicts. Or they may imagine that so signal a progress in industry wants to be completed by as signal a regress in politics. On our part, we do not mistake the shape of the shrewd spirit that continues to mark all these contradictions. We know that to work well the newfangled forces of society, they only want to be mastered by new-fangled men \u2014 and such are the working men. They are as much the invention of modern time as machinery itself. In the signs that bewilder the middle class, the aristocracy and the poor prophets of regression, we do recognise our brave friend, Robin Goodfellow, [A character in Shakespeare\u2019s <i>A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream</i>.] the old mole that can work in the earth so fast, that worthy pioneer \u2014 the Revolution. The English working men are the first-born sons of modern industry. They will then, certainly, not be the last in aiding the social revolution produced by that industry, a revolution, which means the emancipation of their own class all over the world, which is as universal as capital-rule and wages-slavery. I know the heroic struggles the English working class have gone through since the middle of the last century \u2014 struggles less glorious, because they are shrouded in obscurity, and burked by the middle-class historian. To revenge the misdeeds of the ruling class, there existed in the middle ages, in Germany, a secret tribunal, called the \u201cVehmgericht\u201d. [The <i>Vehmgericht</i>, derived from <i>Vehme</i> (judgment, punishment) and <i>Gericht</i> (court), was a secret tribunal which exercised great power in Westphalia from the end of the twelfth to the middle of the sixteenth century.] If a red cross was seen marked on a house, people knew that its owner was doomed by the \u201cVehm.\u201d All the houses of Europe are now marked with the mysterious red cross.

However infamous the conduct of the Sepoys, it is only the reflex, in a concentrated form, of England\u2019s own conduct in India, not only during the epoch of the foundation of her Eastern Empire, but even during the last ten years of a long-settled rule. To characterize that rule, it suffices to say that torture formed an organic institution of its financial policy.

To find parallels to the Sepoy atrocities, we need not, as some London papers pretend, fall back on the middle ages, nor even wander beyond the history of cotemporary England. All we want is to study the first Chinese war, an event, so to say, of yesterday. The English soldiery then committed abominations for the mere fun of it; their passions being neither sanctified by religious fanaticism nor exacerbated by hatred against an overbearing and conquering race, nor provoked by the stern resistance of a heroic enemy. The violations of women, the spittings of children, the roastings of whole villages, were then mere wanton sports, not recorded by Mandarins, but by British officers themselves.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>Even at the present catastrophe it would be an unmitigated mistake to suppose that all the cruelty is on the side of the Sepoys, and all the milk of human kindness flows on the side of the English.

An officer writing from Peshawur gives a description of the disarming of the 10th irregular cavalry for not charging the 55th native infantry when ordered to do so. He exults in the fact that they were not only disarmed, but stripped of their coats and boots, and after having received 12d. per man, were marched down to the river side, and there embarked in boats and sent down the Indus, where the writer is delighted to expect every mother\u2019s son will have a chance of being drowned in the rapids. Another writer informs us that, some inhabitants of Peshawur having caused a night alarm by exploding little mines of gunpowder in honor of a wedding (a national custom), the persons concerned were tied up next morning, and</p>", "<blockquote><a id=\"p5\"></a>\u201creceived such a flogging as they will not easily forget.\u201d</blockquote>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>News arrived from Pindee that three native chiefs were plotting. Sir John Lawrence replied by a message ordering a spy to attend to the meeting. On the spy\u2019s report, Sir John sent a second message, \u201cHang them.\u201d The chiefs were hanged.

For instance, the circumstantial account first appearing in <i>The Times</i>, and then going the round of the London press, of the atrocities perpetrated at Delhi and Meerut, from whom did it proceed? From a cowardly parson residing at Bangalore, Mysore, more than a thousand miles, as the bird flies, distant from the scene of action. Actual accounts of Delhi evince the imagination of an English parson to be capable of breeding greater horrors than even the wild fancy of a Hindoo mutineer. The cutting of noses, breasts, &amp;c., in one word, the horrid mutilations committed by the Sepoys, are of course more revolting to European feeling than the throwing of red-hot shell on Canton dwellings by a Secretary of the Manchester Peace Society, or the roasting of Arabs pent up in a cave by a French Marshal, or the flaying alive of British soldiers by the cat-o\u2019-nine-tails under drum-head court-martial, or any other of the philanthropical appliances used in British penitentiary colonies. Cruelty, like every other thing, has its fashion, changing according to time and place.

It thus describes the historical movement which by divorcing the producers from their means of production transforms them into wage-workers (proletarians in the modern sense of the word) and the owners of the means of production into capitalists. In this history, \u201cevery revolution which acts as a lever for the advancement of the capitalist class in its process of formation marks an epoch; above all that which, by stripping great masses of men of their traditional means of production and subsistence, suddenly hurls them on the labour market. But the basis of this whole development is the expropriation of the agricultural producer. To date this has not been accomplished in a radical fashion anywhere except in England... but all the other countries of Western Europe are undergoing the same process etc.\u201d <i>(Capital</i>, French edition, p. 315). At the end of the chapter the historical tendency of capitalist production is summed up thus: That it \u201citself begets its own negation with the inexorability which governs the metamorphoses of nature\u201d; that it has itself created the elements of a new economic order, by giving the greatest impulse at once to the productive forces of social labour and to the integral development of every individual producer; that capitalist property, which actually rests already on a collective mode of production, can only be transformed into social property.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>I do not give any proof at this point for the very good reason that this assertion itself is nothing but a summary recapitulation of long developments previously set out in the chapters on capitalist production.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>Now, in what way was my critic able to apply this historical sketch to Russia? Only this: if Russia is tending to become a capitalist nation, on the model of the countries of Western Europe, \u2014 and in recent years it has gone to great pains to move in this direction \u2014 it will not succeed without having first transformed a large proportion of its peasants into proletarians; and after that, once it has been placed in the bosom of the capitalist system, it will be subjected to its pitiless laws, like other profane peoples. That is all! But this is too little for my critic. It is absolutely necessary for him to metamorphose my historical sketch of the genesis of capitalism in Western Europe into a historico-philosophical theory of general development, imposed by fate on all peoples, whatever the historical circumstances in which they are placed, in order to eventually attain this economic formation which, with a tremendous leap of the productive forces of social labour, assures the most integral development of every individual producer. But I beg his pardon. This does me too much honour, and yet puts me to shame at the same time. Let us take an example. In various places in <i>Capital</i> I allude to the destiny of the plebeians of Ancient Rome. They were originally free peasants cultivating their own plots of land on their own account. In the course of Roman history they were expropriated. The same movement which cut them off from their means of production and subsistence involved not only the formation of large landed property but also the formation of large money capital. Thus, one fine morning, there were on the one hand free men stripped of everything except their labour power, and on the other, in order to exploit this labour, the owners of all the acquired wealth. What happened? The Roman proletarians became not wage labourers but an idle \u201cmob\u201d, more abject than the former <span class=\"eng\">\u201cpoor whites\u201d</span> of the southern states of America; and alongside them there developed a mode of production that was not capitalist but based on slavery. Thus events strikingly analogous, but occurring in different historical milieux, led to quite disparate results. By studying each of these evolutions on its own, and then comparing them, one will easily discover the key to the phenomenon, but it will never be arrived at by employing the all-purpose formula of a general historico-philosophical theory whose supreme virtue consists in being supra-historical.</p>"], "year": "1877", "sourceBook": "Letter to Otechestvenniye Zapiski", "author": "Marx", "title": "Letter to <i>Otechestvenniye Zapiski</i>", "image": "marxo", "info": "Marx (1877): Letter to Otechestvenniye Zapiski", "idChr": "4.07.02text"}, {"content": ["<p class=\"mid\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p0\"></a>Marx to Vera Zasulich</p>", "<p class=\"right\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><a id=\"p1\"></a>March 8, 1881</p>", "<p class=\"noind\"><a id=\"p2\"></a>Dear Citizen,</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>A nervous complaint which has assailed me periodically over the last ten years has prevented me from replying any sooner to your letter of February 16.

This opposition manifests itself exclusively in the domain of morals, that is, a domain belonging to the history of mankind, and it is precisely in this field that final and ultimate truths are most sparsely sown. The conceptions of good and evil have varied so much from nation to nation and from age to age that they have often been in direct contradiction to each other. \u2014 But all the same, someone may object, good is not evil and evil is not good; if good is confused with evil there is an end to all morality, and everyone can do as he pleases. \u2014 This is also, stripped of all oracular phrases, Herr D\u00fchring\u2019s opinion. But the matter cannot be so simply disposed of. If it were such an easy business there would certainly be no dispute at all over good and evil; everyone would know what was good and what was bad. But how do things stand today? What morality is preached to us today? There is first Christian-feudal morality, inherited from earlier religious times; and this is divided, essentially, into a Catholic and a Protestant morality, each of which has no lack of subdivisions, from the Jesuit-Catholic and Orthodox-Protestant to loose \u201cenlightened\u201d moralities. Alongside these we find the modern-bourgeois morality and beside it also the proletarian morality of the future, so that in the most advanced European countries alone the past, present and future provide three great groups of moral theories which are in force simultaneously and alongside each other. Which, then, is the true one? Not one of them, in the sense of absolute finality; but certainly that morality contains the maximum elements promising permanence which, in the present, represents the overthrow of the present, represents the future, and that is proletarian morality.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p1\"></a>But when we see that the three classes of modern society, the feudal aristocracy, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, each have a morality of their own, we can only draw the one conclusion: that men, consciously or unconsciously, derive their ethical ideas in the last resort from the practical relations on which their class position is based \u2014 from the economic relations in which they carry on production and exchange.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p2\"></a>But nevertheless there is great deal which the three moral theories mentioned above have in common \u2014 is this not at least a portion of a morality which is fixed once and for all? \u2014 These moral theories represent three different stages of the same historical development, have therefore a common historical background, and for that reason alone they necessarily have much in common. Even more. At similar or approximately similar stages of economic development moral theories must of necessity be more or less in agreement. From the moment when private ownership of movable property developed, all societies in which this private ownership existed had to have this moral injunction in common: Thou shalt not steal. [Exodus 20 : 15; Deuteronomy 5 : 19.] Does this injunction thereby become an eternal moral injunction? By no means. In a society in which all motives for stealing have been done away with, in which therefore at the very most only lunatics would ever steal, how the preacher of morals would be laughed at who tried solemnly to proclaim the eternal truth: Thou shalt not steal!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>We therefore reject every attempt to impose on us any moral dogma whatsoever as an eternal, ultimate and for ever immutable ethical law on the pretext that the moral world, too, has its permanent principles which stand above history and the differences between nations. We maintain on the contrary that all moral theories have been hitherto the product, in the last analysis, of the economic conditions of society obtaining at the time. And as society has hitherto moved in class antagonisms, morality has always been class morality; it has either justified the domination and the interests of the ruling class, or ever since the oppressed class became powerful enough, it has represented its indignation against this domination and the future interests of the oppressed. That in this process there has on the whole been progress in morality, as in all other branches of human knowledge, no one will doubt. But we have not yet passed beyond class morality. A really human morality which stands above class antagonisms and above any recollection of them becomes possible only at a stage of society which has not only overcome class antagonisms but has even forgotten them in practical life. And now one can gauge Herr D\u00fchring\u2019s presumption in advancing his claim, from the midst of the old class society and on the eve of a social revolution, to impose on the future classless society an eternal morality independent of time and changes in reality.

Bakunin and his followers withdrew from the League and, in the same year, formed an International Alliance of Socialist Democracy.] and at once began to conspire within it against the General Council. Bakunin has a singular theory, a potpourri of Proudhonism and communism, the chief point of which is first of all, that he does not regard capital, and hence the class antagonism between capitalists and wage workers which has arisen through the development of society, as the main evil to be abolished, but instead the <i>state</i>. While the great mass of the Social-Democratic workers hold our view that state power is nothing more than the organisation with which the ruling classes \u2014 landowners and capitalists \u2014 have provided themselves in order to protect their social privileges, Bakunin maintains that the <i>state</i> has created capital, that the capitalist has his capital only <i>by the grace of the state</i>. And since the state is the chief evil, the state above all must be abolished; then capital will go to hell of itself. We, on the contrary, say: Abolish capital, the appropriation of all the means of production by the few, and the state will fall of itself. The difference is an essential one: the abolition of the state is nonsense without a social revolution beforehand; the abolition of capital is the social revolution and involves a change in the whole mode of production. However, since for Bakunin the state is the main evil, nothing must be done that can keep the state alive, i.e. any state, republic, monarchy, or whatever it may be. Hence, <i>complete abstention from all politics</i>. To commit a political action, especially to take part in an election, would be a betrayal of principle. The thing to do is to conduct propaganda, revile the state, organise, and when <i>all</i> the workers are won over, that is, the majority, to depose the authorities, abolish the state, and replace it by the organisation of the International. This great act, with which the millennium begins, is called <i>social liquidation</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>All this sounds extremely radical and is so simple that it can be learned by heart in five minutes, and that is why this Bakuninist theory has also rapidly found favour in Italy and Spain among the young lawyers, doctors, and other doctrinaires. But the mass of the workers will never allow themselves to be persuaded that the public affairs of their country are not also their own affairs; they are by nature <i>political</i> and whoever tries to convince them that they should leave politics alone will in the end be left in the lurch by them. To preach that the workers should abstain from politics under all circumstances means driving them into the arms of the priests or the bourgeois republicans.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>Now as, according to Bakunin, the International was not formed for political struggle but in order that it might at once replace the old machinery of state when social liquidation occurs, it follows that it must come as near as possible to the Bakuninist ideal of future society. In this society there will above all be no <i>authority</i>, for authority=state=evil in the absolute. (How these people propose to operate a factory, run a railway, or steer a ship without one will that decides in the last resort, without unified direction, they do not, of course, tell us.) The authority of the majority over the minority also ceases. Every individual, every community, is autonomous, but how a society of even two people is possible unless each gives up some of his autonomy, Bakunin again keeps to himself.</p>"], "year": "1872", "sourceBook": "To Theodor Cuno", "author": "Engels", "title": "", "image": "engels", "info": "Engels (1872): To Theodor Cuno", "idChr": "5.05.02text"}, {"content": ["<p><a id=\"p0\"></a>A number of socialists have latterly launched a regular crusade against what they call the <i>principle of authority</i>. It is sufficient for them to say that this or that act is <i>authoritarian</i> for it to be condemned. This summary mode of procedure is being abused to such an extent that it has become necessary to look into the matter somewhat more closely. Authority, in the sense in which the word is used here, means: the imposition of the will of another upon ours; on the other hand, authority presupposes subordination. Now, since these two words sound bad and the relationship which they represent is disagreeable to the subordinated party, the question is to ascertain whether there is any way of dispensing with it, whether \u2014 given the conditions of present-day society \u2014 we could not create another social system, in which this authority would be given no scope any longer and would consequently have to disappear. On examining the economic, industrial and agricultural conditions which form the basis of present-day bourgeois society, we find that they tend more and more to replace isolated action by combined action of individuals. Modern industry with its big factories and mills, where hundreds of workers supervise complicated machines driven by steam, has superseded the small workshops of the separate producers; the carriages and wagons of the highways have been substituted by railway trains, just as the small schooners and sailing feluccas have been by steam-boats. Even agriculture falls increasingly under the dominion of the machine and of steam, which slowly but relentlessly put in the place of the small proprietors big capitalists, who with the aid of hired workers cultivate vast stretches of land. Everywhere combined action, the complication of processes dependent upon each other, displaces independent action by individuals. But whoever mentions combined action speaks of organisation; now, is it possible to have organisation without authority?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p1\"></a>Supposing a social revolution dethroned the capitalists, who now exercise their authority over the production and circulation of wealth. Supposing, to adopt entirely the point of view of the anti-authoritarians, that the land and the instruments of labour had become the collective property of the workers who use them. Will authority have disappeared or will it only have changed its form? Let us see.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p2\"></a>Let us take by way of example a cotton spinning mill. The cotton must pass through at least six successive operations before it is reduced to the state of thread, and these operations take place for the most part in different rooms. Furthermore, keeping the machines going requires an engineer to look after the steam engine, mechanics to make the current repairs, and many other labourers whose business it is to transfer the products from one room to another, and so forth. All these workers, men, women and children, are obliged to begin and finish their work at the hours fixed by the authority of the steam, which cares nothing for individual autonomy. The workers must, therefore, first come to an understanding on the hours of work; and these hours, once they are fixed, must be observed by all, without any exception. Thereafter particular questions arise in each room and at every moment concerning the mode of production, distribution of materials, etc., which must be settled at once on pain of seeing all production immediately stopped; whether they are settled by decision of a delegate placed at the head of each branch of labour or, if possible, by a majority vote, the will of the single individual will always have to subordinate itself, which means that questions are settled in an authoritarian way. The automatic machinery of a big factory is much more despotic than the small capitalists who employ workers ever have been. At least with regard to the hours of work one may write upon the portals of these factories: <i>Lasciate ogni autonomia, voi che entrate!</i> [\u201cLeave, ye that enter in, all autonomy behind!\u201d (Dante, The Divine Comedy, Hell, Canto III, Verse 3 \u2014 paraphrased).] If man, by dint of his knowledge and inventive genius, has subdued the forces of nature, the latter avenge themselves upon him by subjecting him, in so far as he employs them, to a veritable despotism independent of all social organisation. Wanting to abolish authority in large-scale industry is tantamount to wanting to abolish industry itself, to destroy the power loom in order to return to the spinning wheel.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>Let us take another example \u2014 the railway. Here, too, the co-operation of an infinite number of individuals is absolutely necessary, and this co-operation must be practised during precisely fixed hours so that no accidents may happen. Here, too, the first condition of the job is a dominant will that settles all subordinate questions, whether this will is represented by a single delegate or a committee charged with the execution of the resolutions of the majority of persons interested. In either case there is very pronounced authority. Moreover, what would happen to the first train despatched if the authority of the railway employees over the Hon. passengers were abolished?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>But the necessity of authority, and of imperious authority at that, will nowhere be found more evident than on board a ship on the high seas. There, in time of danger, the lives of all depend on the instantaneous and absolute obedience of all to the will of one.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>When I submitted arguments like these to the most rabid anti-authoritarians the only answer they were able to give me was the following: Yes, that\u2019s true, but here it is not a case of authority which we confer on our delegates, <i>but of a commission entrusted!</i> These gentlemen think that when they have changed the names of things they have changed the things themselves. This is how these profound thinkers mock at the whole world.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>We have thus seen that, on the one hand, a certain authority, no matter how delegated, and, on the other hand, a certain subordination, are things which, independently of all social organisation, are imposed upon us together with the material conditions under which we produce and make products circulate.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>We have seen, besides, that the material conditions of production and circulation inevitably develop with large-scale industry and large-scale agriculture, and increasingly tend to enlarge the scope of this authority. Hence it is absurd to speak of the principle of authority as being absolutely evil, and of the principle of autonomy as being absolutely good. Authority and autonomy are relative things whose spheres vary with the various phases of the development of society. If the autonomists confined themselves to saying that the social organisation of the future would restrict authority solely to the limits within which the conditions of production render it inevitable, we could understand each other; but they are blind to all facts that make the thing necessary and they passionately fight the word.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>Why do the anti-authoritarians not confine themselves to crying out against political authority, the state? All socialists are agreed that the political state, and with it political authority, will disappear as a result of the coming social revolution, that is, that public functions will lose their political character and be transformed into the simple administrative functions of watching over the true interests of society. But the anti-authoritarians demand that the authoritarian political state be abolished at one stroke, even before the social conditions that gave birth to it have been destroyed. They demand that the first act of the social revolution shall be the abolition of authority. Have these gentlemen ever seen a revolution? A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon \u2014 authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionaries. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois? Should we not, on the contrary, reproach it for not having used it freely enough?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>Therefore, either one of two things: either the anti-authoritarians don\u2019t know what they are talking about, in which case they are creating nothing but confusion; or they do know, and in that case they are betraying the movement of the proletariat.

For Morgan rediscovered in America, in his own way, the materialist conception of history that had been discovered by Marx forty years ago, and in his comparison of barbarism and civilisation was led by this conception to the same conclusions, in the main points, as Marx. And just as <i>Capital</i> was for years both zealously plagiarised and persistently hushed up by the official economists in Germany, so was Morgan\u2019s <i>Ancient Society</i> [<i>Ancient Society, or Researches in the Lines of Human Progress from Savagery through Barbarism to Civilization</i>.

But this itself is again of a twofold character. On the one hand, the production of the means of subsistence, of food, clothing and shelter and the implements required for this; on the other, the production of human beings themselves, the propagation of the species. The social institutions under which men of a definite historical epoch and of a definite country live are determined by both kinds of production: by the stage of development of labour, on the one hand, and of the family, on the other. The less labour is developed and the more limited the volume of its products and, therefore, the wealth of society, the more predominantly the social order appears to be dominated by ties of kinship. However, within this structure of society based on ties of kinship, the productivity of labour develops more and more; with it, private property and exchange, differences in wealth, the possibility of utilising the labour power of others, and thereby the basis of class antagonisms: new social elements, which strive in the course of generations to adapt the old structure of society to the new conditions, until, finally, incompatibility of the two leads to a complete transformation. The old society, based on ties of kinship, bursts asunder with the collision of the newly developed social classes; in its place a new society appears, constituted in a state, the lower units of which are no longer groups based on ties of kinship but territorial groups, a society in which the family system is entirely dominated by the property system, and in which the class antagonisms and class struggle, which make up the content of all hitherto <i>written</i> history now freely unfold.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>Morgan\u2019s great merit lies in having discovered and reconstructed this prehistoric foundation of our written history in its main features, and in having found in the ties of kinship of the North American Indians the key to the most important, hitherto insoluble, riddles of the earliest Greek, Roman and German history. His book, however, was not the work of one day. He grappled with his material for nearly forty years until he completely mastered it. But for this reason his book is one of the few epoch-making works of our time.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>In the following exposition the reader will, on the whole, easily be able to distinguish between what has been taken from Morgan and what I have added myself.

The sections dealing with the Celts and the Germans are substantially my own; here Morgan had at his disposal almost exclusively second-hand sources, and, as far as German conditions were concerned \u2014 with the exception of Tacitus \u2014 only the wretched liberal falsification of Mr. Freeman. The economic arguments, sufficient for Morgan\u2019s purpose but wholly inadequate for my own, have all been elaborated afresh by myself.

More than that was never maintained either by Marx or myself. Now if someone distorts this by declaring the economic moment to be the <i>only</i> determining factor, he changes that proposition into a meaningless, abstract, ridiculous piece of jargon. The economic situation is the basis, but the various factors of the superstructure \u2014 political forms of the class struggle and its consequences, namely constitutions set up by the ruling class after a victorious battle, etc., forms of law and, the reflections of all these real struggles in the minds of the participants, i.e. political, philosophical and legal theories, religious views and the expansion of the same into dogmatic systems \u2014 all these factors also have a bearing on the course of the historical struggles of which, in many cases, they largely determine the form. It is in the interaction of all these factors and amidst an unending multitude of fortuities (i.e. of things and events whose intrinsic interconnections are so remote or so incapable of proof that we can regard them as non-existent and ignore them) that the economic trend ultimately asserts itself as something inevitable. Otherwise the application of the theory to any particular period of history would, after all, be easier than solving a simple equation of the first degree.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>We make our history ourselves but, in the first place, under very definite premises and conditions. Of these, the economic are ultimately decisive. But the political, etc., and even the traditions still lingering in people\u2019s minds, play some, if not a decisive, role. The Prussian state itself owes its origin and development to historical and, in the final analysis, economic circumstances. It could, however, hardly be maintained without pedantry that what caused Brandenburg, of all the many small principalities of North Germany, to become a great power, the embodiment of the economic, linguistic and \u2014 since the Reformation \u2014 also the religious, differences between North and South, was economic necessity irrespective of any other factors (above all its involvement, through its possession of Prussia, in Poland and hence in international political relations \u2014 which likewise played a decisive role in the formation of the Austrian dynasty). Without making oneself a laughing-stock, it would scarcely be possible to provide an economic explanation for the existence of every small German principality, past and present, or for the origin of the High German sound shift whereby the geographical partition formed by the mountains from the Sudetes to the Taunus became a veritable rift running right across Germany.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>In the second place, however, history is made in such a way that the ultimate result is invariably produced by the clash of many individual wills of which each in turn has been made what it is by a wide variety of living conditions; there are thus innumerable conflicting forces, an infinite number of parallelograms of forces, productive of one result \u2014 the historical event which itself may be seen as the product of a power operating <i>unconsciously</i> and involuntarily as a whole. For what each individual wants is obstructed by every other individual and the outcome is something that no one wanted. Thus, the course of history up till now has been like a natural process and has, indeed, been subject to much the same laws of motion. But the fact that individual wills \u2014 each of which wants what it is driven to want by bodily constitution and extrinsic and, in the final analysis, economic (whether personal or general social) circumstances \u2014 do not attain what they want but merge into an overall mean, a common resultant \u2014 does not justify the conclusion that they are nonentities. On the contrary, each one contributes to the resultant and is, to that extent, part and parcel of it.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>Another thing I would ask you to do is to study this theory in the original source books and not at second-hand; it is really far easier. While Marx wrote hardly anything in which it did not play some role, <i>The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</i> is a quite outstanding example of its application. There are also many allusions to the theory in <i>Capital</i>. I might further draw your attention to my works, <i>Herr Eugen D\u00fchring\u2019s Revolution in Science</i> and <i>Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy</i> in which the account I give of historical materialism is, so far as I know, the most exhaustive in existence.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>If some younger writers attribute more importance to the economic aspect than is its due, Marx and I are to some extent to blame. We had to stress this leading principle in the face of opponents who denied it, and we did not always have the time, space or opportunity to do justice to the other factors that interacted upon each other. But it was a different matter when it came to depicting a section of history, i.e. to applying the theory in practice, and here there was no possibility of error. Unfortunately people all too frequently believe they have mastered a new theory and can do just what they like with it as soon as they have grasped \u2014 not always correctly \u2014 its main propositions.

But it is obvious that, in instances 2 and 3, political power can wreak havoc with economic development and cause energy and materials to be squandered on a vast scale.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>Then again there is the instance of the seizure and brutal destruction of economic resources which, in earlier days and in certain circumstances, could ruin economic development both locally and nationally. Today, this would mostly have the opposite effect, at least where the larger nations are concerned. In the long run the vanquished may have more to gain economically, politically and morally than, on occasion, the victor.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>It is much the same in the case of the law: As soon as the new division of labour becomes necessary and creates professional lawyers, yet another new, independent field is opened up which, for all its general dependence on production and trade, is nevertheless capable of reacting in its own way to those spheres. In a modern state not only must the law correspond to the general economic situation and be its expression, it must <i>of itself</i> constitute a <i>coherent</i> expression that does not, by reason of internal contradictions, give itself the lie. And to achieve this, the fidelity with which economic conditions are reflected is increasingly thrown to the winds. All the more so for the rarity with which a statute book is the harsh, unmitigated, unadulterated expression of the domination of one class: this of itself would be contrary to the \u2018concept of law\u2019. The pure, logical concept of law of the revolutionary bourgeoisie of 1792-96 had already been adulterated in many respects even in the Code Napol\u00e9on and, in so far as it was embodied therein, has had to be constantly subjected to all manner of modifications as a result of the growing power of the proletariat. Not that this has prevented the Code Napol\u00e9on from being the statute book on which all new codifications in every part of the world are based. Thus the course of the \u2018law\u2019s development\u2019 has largely consisted simply in this: Firstly, the attempt to eliminate the contradictions arising from the direct translation of economic conditions into legal principles and to establish an harmonious legal system and, secondly, the fact that the influence and pressure of further economic developments repeatedly disrupt that system, involving it in fresh contradictions (at this stage I am speaking only of civil law).</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>The reflection of economic conditions as legal principles is likewise necessarily one that presents the image the wrong way up; it does so without the beholder being aware of it; the lawyer imagines he is dealing in a priori principles whereas they are, in fact, no more than economic reflections \u2014 and thus the whole thing is the wrong way up. And it seems to me self-evident that this inversion which, in as much as it is not recognised, constitutes what we call an <i>ideological view</i>, reacts in its turn on the economic base and may, within certain limits, modify the same. The basis of the law of inheritance, assuming the family to have attained the same stage of development, is an economic one. Nevertheless, it would be difficult to prove that, for instance, absolute testamentary freedom in England and the strict limits imposed thereon in France are in every respect of economic origin. But both, in a very significant way, react on the economy in that they influence the distribution of wealth.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>Now as regards the more rarefied ideological fields such as religion, philosophy, etc.; these have a prehistorical fund of what today would be termed rubbish which was taken over lock, stock and barrel by the historical period. In so far as these various false conceptions of nature, of the nature of man, of spirits, magic forces, etc., are economically based, it is only in a negative sense; false conceptions of nature are the corollary of the low level of economic development in the prehistorical period, but also on occasion its precondition if not its actual cause. And even if economic necessity may have provided the main incentive for progress in natural science and done so to an increasing extent, it would be pedantic to seek economic causes for all this primitive rubbish. The history of science is the history of the gradual elimination of that rubbish and/or its replacement by new, if progressively less ridiculous, rubbish. The people responsible for this in turn belong to special spheres of the division of labour and see themselves as working in an independent field. And to the extent that they constitute an independent group within the social division of labour, what they produce, including their errors, exerts a reciprocal influence on social development as a whole and even on economic development. But for all that, they are themselves in their turn subject to the dominant influence of economic development. In philosophy, for example, this is most easily demonstrated in respect of the bourgeois period. Hobbes was the first modern materialist (in the 18th-century sense), but an absolutist at a time when, throughout Europe, absolute monarchy was in its heyday and, in England, was embarking on a struggle with the populace. In religion as in politics, Locke was the product of the class compromise of 1688. The English deists and their more logical successors, the French materialists, were the true philosophers of the bourgeoisie \u2014 and, in the case of the French, even of the bourgeois revolution. German philosophy, from Kant to Hegel, is permeated by the German philistine \u2014 now in a positive, now in a negative, sense. But in every epoch philosophy, as a definite sphere of the division of labour, presupposes a definite fund of ideas inherited from its predecessors and from which it takes its departure. And that is why economically backward countries can nevertheless play first fiddle where philosophy is concerned \u2014 France in the 18th century as compared with England, upon whose philosophy the French based themselves and, later on, Germany as compared with both. But in France as in Germany, philosophy, like the general flowering of literature at that time, was also the result of growing economic prosperity. I am in no doubt about the ultimate supremacy of economic development over these fields also, but it will come about within the terms laid down by each individual field; in philosophy, for instance, by the operation of economic influences (which again for the most part operate only in their political, etc., guise) on extant philosophical material handed down by predecessors. Here, political economy creates nothing <i>a novo</i> [from scratch], but determines the way in which the existing fund of ideas changes and develops, and this too is done for the most part indirectly, since it is its political, legal and moral reflections which exert the greatest immediate influence on philosophy.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>As for religion, I have said all that is necessary in the last chapter of Feuerbach.

Engels, <i>Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy</i>.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>So if Barth opines that we deny that the political, etc., reflections of the economic trend have any effect whatsoever on that trend itself, he is simply tilting at windmills. After all, he only has to look at Marx\u2019s <i>Eighteenth Brumaire</i> which is devoted almost exclusively to the <i>particular</i> role played by political struggles and events \u2014 needless to say within the framework of their <i>general</i> dependence on economic conditions. Or again at <i>Capital</i>, e.g. the section on the working day where legislation, which is, after all, a political act, appears in such an uncompromising light. Or at the section on the history of the bourgeoisie (Chapter 24). Otherwise why should we be fighting for the political dictatorship of the proletariat if political power is economically powerless?

If I have any criticism to make, it is that you accord me more merit than I deserve, even if one takes account of what I may, perhaps, have found out for myself \u2014 in course of time \u2014 but which Marx, with his swifter <i>coup d\u2019oeil</i> [insight] and greater discernment, discovered much more quickly. If one has been fortunate enough to spend forty years collaborating with a man like Marx, one tends, during one\u2019s lifetime, to receive less recognition than one feels is due to one; when the greater man dies, however, the lesser may easily come to be overrated \u2014 and that is exactly what seems to have happened in my case; all this will eventually be put right by history, and by then one will be safely out of the way and know nothing at all about it.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>Otherwise only one point has been omitted, a point which, however, was never given sufficient weight by Marx and myself in our work, and in regard to which we are all equally at fault. For we all of us began, as <i>we were bound to do</i>, by placing the main emphasis on the <i>derivation</i> of political, legal and other ideological conceptions, as of the actions induced by those conceptions, from economic fundamentals. In so doing we neglected the formal in favour of the substantial aspect, i.e. the manner in which the said conceptions, etc., arise. This provided our opponents with a welcome pretext for misinterpretation, not to say distortion, Paul Barth being a notable case in point. [P. Barth, <i>Die Geschichtsphilosphie Hegel\u2019s und der Hegelianer bis auf Marx und Hartmann</i>. Ein Kritischer Versuch.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>Ideology is a process which is, it is true, carried out consciously by what we call a thinker, but with a consciousness that is spurious. The actual motives by which he is impelled remain hidden from him, for otherwise it would not be an ideological process. Hence the motives he supposes himself to have are either spurious or illusory. Because it is a mental process, he sees both its substance and its form as deriving solely from thought \u2014 either his own or that of his predecessors. He works solely with conceptual material which he automatically assumes to have been engendered by thought without inquiring whether it might not have some more remote origin unconnected therewith; indeed, he takes this for granted since, to him, all action is <i>induced</i> by thought, and therefore appears in the final analysis, to be <i>motivated</i>, by thought.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>The historical ideologist (here historical is used as an omnibus term for political, legal, philosophical, theological, in short, for all spheres appertaining to <i>society</i> and not merely to nature) \u2014 the historical ideologist, then, possesses in every sphere of science a material which has originated independently in the thought of previous generations and has undergone an independent course of development of its own in the brains of these successive generations. True, external facts appertaining to one sphere or another may also have helped to determine that development but according to what has been tacitly assumed, those facts, themselves are merely the fruits of a mental process, and thus we still find ourselves in the realm of pure thought which would appear to have succeeded in assimilating even the most recalcitrant facts.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>What has above all deluded the majority of people is this semblance of an independent history of political constitutions, legal systems and ideological conceptions in each individual sphere. When Luther and Calvin \u2018overcome\u2019 the official Catholic faith, when Hegel \u2018overcomes\u2019 Fichte and Kant, or when, with his republican Contrat social, Rousseau indirectly \u2018overcomes\u2019 the constitutionalist Montesquieu, the process is one which remains within the confines of theology, philosophy and political science, which represents a stage in the history of these spheres of thought and never emerges from the sphere of thought. And since the advent of the bourgeois illusion of the eternity and ultimacy of capitalist production, even the overcoming of the Mercantilists by the Physiocrats and Adam Smith has come to be regarded merely as a victory of the concept, not as the conceptual reflection of changed economic facts, but as the correct perception, now at last achieved, of actual conditions as they have always and everywhere existed. If Richard Coeur-de-Lion and Philip Augustus had introduced free trade instead of becoming involved in the Crusades, we should have been spared five hundred years of misery and folly.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>We have all, I believe, neglected this aspect of the matter, which I can only touch on here, to a greater extent than it deserves. It\u2019s the same old story \u2014 initially, form is always neglected in favour of substance. As I have said, I, too, have done this, never realising my mistake until after the event. Far be it from me, therefore, to reproach you on that score \u2014 as the senior culprit I am in no way entitled to do so, quite the contrary \u2014 but rather I would draw your attention to this point with a view to future occasions.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p10\"></a>Hand in hand with this goes the ideologists\u2019 fatuous conception that, because we deny independent historical development to the various ideological spheres which play a role in history, we also deny them any <i>historical efficacy</i>. Underlying this is the ordinary, undialectical conception of cause and effect as rigidly opposite poles, quite regardless of any interaction.

Their aspirations are at variance, which is why all such societies are governed by <i>necessity</i> of which the counterpart and manifestation is <i>chance</i>. The necessity which here invariably prevails over chance is again ultimately economic. This brings us to the question of what are known as great men. The fact that such and such a man, and he alone, should arise at a particular time in any given country, is, of course, purely fortuitous. But if we eliminate him, a replacement will be called for and such a replacement will be found \u2014 <i>tant bien que mal</i> [for better or for worse], but found he will ultimately be. That Napoleon, this particular Corsican, was the military dictator rendered necessary by a French Republic bled white by her own wars, was fortuitous; but that, in the absence of a Napoleon, someone else would have taken his place is proved by the fact that the moment someone becomes necessary \u2014 Caesar, Augustus, Cromwell, etc. \u2014 he invariably turns up. If it was Marx who discovered the materialist view of history, the work of Thierry, Mignett Guizot and every English historiographer prior to 1850 goes to show that efforts were being made in that direction, while the discovery of the same view by Morgan shows that the time was ripe for it and that it was <i>bound</i> to be discovered.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>The same thing applies to all fortuitous and seemingly fortuitous events in history.
