[{"content": ["<p>\u00a0</p>", "<p class=\"noind\"><a id=\"p0\"></a>Dear Comrade Lenin,</p>", "<p><a id=\"p1\"></a>I have read your brochure on the Radicalism in the Communist movement. It has taught me a great deal, as all your writings have done. For this I feel grateful to you, and doubtless many other comrades feel as I do. Many a trace, and many a germ of this infant disease, to which without a doubt, I also am a victim, has been clipped away by your brochure, or will yet be eradicated by it. Your observations about the confusion the revolution has caused in many brains, is quite right too. I know that. The revolution came so suddenly, and in a way so utterly different from what we expected. Your words will be an incentive, to me, once again, and to an even greater extent than before, to base my judgment in all matters of tactics, also in the revolution, exclusively on reality, on the actual class-relations, as they manifest themselves politically and economically.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p2\"></a>After having read your brochure, I thought all this is right.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>But after having considered for a long time whether now I would cease to uphold this \u201cLeft Wing,\u201d and to write articles for the K.A.P.D. and the opposition party in England, I had to decline.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p4\"></a>Basis Mistaken</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>This seems contradictory. It is due, though, to the fact that the starting-point in the brochure is not right. To my idea you are mistaken in your judgment regarding the analogy of the West-European revolution with the Russian one, regarding the conditions of the West-European revolution, that is to say the class-relations \u2014 and this leads you to mistake the cause, from which this Left Wing, the opposition, originates.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>Therefore the brochure SEEMS to be right, as long as your starting-point is assumed. If, however (as it should be), your starting point is rejected, <i>the entire brochure is wrong</i>. As all your mistaken, and partly mistaken judgments converge in your condemnation of the Left movement, especially in Germany and England, and as I firmly intend to defend those of the Left Wing, although, as the leaders know, I do not agree with them on all points, I imagine I had best answer your brochure by a defence of the Left Wing. This will enable me not only to point out its origin (the cause from which it springs), and to prove its right, and merits, in the present stage, and here, in Western Europe, but also, which is of equal importance, <i>to combat the mistaken conceptions that are prevalent in Russia with regard to the West-European Revolution</i>.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>Both these points are of importance, as it is on the conception of the West-European revolution that the West-European as well as the Russian tactics depend.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>I should have liked to do this at the Moscow Congress, which, however, I was not able to attend.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_2\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p9\"></a>Two Arguments Refuted</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p10\"></a>In the first place I must refute two of your arguments, that may mislead the judgment of comrades or readers. You scoff and sneer at the ridiculous and childish nonsense of the struggle in many, at the \u201cdictatorship of the leaders or of the masses,\u201d at \u201cfrom above or below,\u201d etc. We quite agree with you, that these should be no questions at all. But we do not agree with your scoffing. For that is thp pity of it: in Western-Europe they still are questions. In Western Europe we still have, in many countries, leaders of the type of the Second International; here we are still seeking the right leaders, those that <i>do not try to dominate the masses</i>, that do not betray them; and as long as we do not find those, we want to do all things from below, and through the dictatorship of the masses themselves. If I have a mountain-guide, and he should lead me into the abyss, I prefer to do without him. As soon as we have found the right guides, we will stop this searching. Then mass and leader will be really one. Thus, and nothing else, is what the German and English Left Wing, what we ourselves, mean by these words. [Remark of the Editor: The K.A.P.D. wants more, to be sure. <i>It claims, ever more urgently this:</i> \u201cFROM BELOW.\u201d]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p11\"></a>And the same holds good for your second remark, that the leader should form one united whole with class and mass. We quite agree with you. But the question is to find and rear leaders that are really one with the masses. This can only be accomplished by the masses, the political parties and the Trade Unions, by means of the most severe struggle, also inwardly. And the same holds good for the iron discipline, and the strong centralisation. We want them all right, but not until we have the right leaders. This severest of all struggles, which is now being fought most strenuously in Germany and England, the two countries where Communism is nearest to its realisation, can only be harmed by your scoffing. Your attitude panders to the opportunist elements in the Third International. By thus scoffing, you abet the opportunist elements in the Third International. For it is one of the means by which elements in the Spartacus League and in the B.S.P., and also in the Communist Parties in many other countries, imposes upon the workers, when they say that the entire question of mass and leader is absurd, is \u201cnonsense and childishness.\u201d Through this phrase they avoid, and wish to avoid, all criticism of themselves, the leaders. It is by means of this phrase of an iron discipline and centralisation, that they crush the opposition. And this opportunism is abetted by you.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p12\"></a>You should not do this, Comrade. We are only in the introductory stage yet, here, in Western Europe. And in that stage it is better to encourage the fighters than the rulers.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p13\"></a>I only touch upon this quite perfunctorily here. In the course of this writihg I will deal with this matter more at length. There is a deeper reason yet why I cannot agree with your brochure. It is the following: \u2014</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p14\"></a>Difference between Russia and Western Europe</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p15\"></a>On reading your pamphlets, brochures and books, nearly all of which writings filled us with admiration and approbation, we Marxists of Western Europe invariably came to a point where we suddenly grew wary, and on the look-out for a more detailed explanation; and if we failed to find this explanation, we accepted the statement but grudgingly, with all due reservations. This was your statement regarding the workers and the poor peasants. It occurs often, very often. And you always mention both these categories as revolutionary factors all the world over. And nowhere, at least as far as I have read, is there a clear and outspoken recognition of the immense difference which prevails in the matter between Russia (and a few other countries in Eastern Europe) and Western Europe (that is to say Germany, France, England, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, and the Scandinavian countries, and perhaps even Italy). And yet, in my opinion, the fundamental difference between your conception of the tactics concerning Trade Unionism and Parliamentarism, and that of the so-called Left Wing in Western Europe, lies mainly in this point.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p16\"></a>Of course you know this difference as well as I do, only you failed to draw from it the conclusions for the tactics in Western Europe, at least as far as I am able to judge from your works. These conclusions you have not taken into considerration, and consequently your judgment on these West-European tactics is false. [In \u201cState and Revolution,\u201d for instance, you write (page 67): \u201cThe greatest majority of the peasantry in every capitalist country that has any peasantry at all, is oppressed by the government and is thirsting for the latter\u2019s overthrow, for a \u201ccheap\u201d government. The proletariat alone is called upon to carry this into execution...\u201d The trouble is, however, that the peasantry does <i>not</i> thirst for Communism.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p17\"></a>And this is all the more dangerous, because this phrase of yours is parroted automatically in all Communist Parties of Western Europe, even by Marxists. To judge from all Communist papers, magazines and brochures, and from all public assemblies, one might even surmise that a revolt of the poor peasants in Western Europe might break out at any moment! Nowhere is the great difference with Russia pointed out, and thus the judgment, also of the proletariat, is led astray. Because in Russia you disposed of a huge class of poor peasants, through the help of which you triumphed, you represent things in such a way, as if we in Western Europe are also going to have that help. Because you, in Russia, have triumphed exclusively through this help, you wish to make us believe that here also we will triumph through this help. You do this by means of your silence with regard to this question, as it stands in Western Europe, and your entire tactics are based on this representation.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_4\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p18\"></a>Poor Peasants Decisive Factor</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p19\"></a>This representation, however, is not the truth. There is an enormous difference between Russia and Western Europe. In general the importance of the poor peasants as a revolutionary factor decreases from east to west. In some parts of Asia, China, and India, in the case of a revolution, this class would be the absolutely decisive factor; in Russia it constitutes an indispensable and, indeed, one of the main factors; in Poland, and in a few states of South-Eastern and Central Europe, it is still of importance for the revolution, but further West its attitude grows ever more antagonistic towards the revolution.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p20\"></a>Russia had an industrial proletariat of some seven or eight millions. The number of poor peasants, however, amounted to about 25 millions. (I beg you to excuse eventual mistakes in the numbers; I have to cite from memory, as this letter should be despatched with all speed). When Kerensky failed to give these poor peasants the soil, you knew that before long they would come to you, the minute they should become aware of the fact. This is not so in Western Europe, and will not be so either; in the countries of Western Europe, which I have named, conditions of that sort do not exist.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p21\"></a>The poor peasant here lives under conditions quite different from those of Russia. Though often terrible, they are not so appalling as they were there. As farmers or owners, the poor peasants possess a piece of land. The excellent means of transport enables them often to sell their goods. At the very worst they can mostly provide their own food. During the last ten years things have improved somewhat for them. Now, during and since the war, they can obtain high prices. They are indispensable, the import, of foodstuffs being very limited. Regularly, therefore, they will be able to make high prices. They are supported by Capitalism. Capitalism will maintain them, as long as it can maintain itself. In your country the position of the poor peasants was far more terrible. With you, therefore, the poor peasants had a political, revolutionary programme, and were organised in a political, revolutionary party: with the social-revolutionaries. With us this is nowhere the case. Moreover, in Russia there was an enormous amount of landed property to be divided, large estates, crown lands, government land, and the estates held by the monasteries. But the Communists of Western Europe, what can they offer to the poor peasants, to win them to their side?</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_5\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p22\"></a>Nothing to offer Peasants</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p23\"></a>Germany counted, before the war, from four to five million poor peasants (up to two hectares). Only eight or nine millions, however, were employed in actual large-scale industries (over 100 hectares). If the Communists were to divide all of these, the poor peasants would still be poor peasants, as the seven or eight million field-labourers also claim their share. And they cannot even divide them, as they will use them as large-scale industries. [The Agrarian Theses of Moscow acknowledges this.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p24\"></a>These numbers show that in Western Europe there are comparatively few poor peasants; that, therefore, the auxiliary forces, if there were, any at all, would be very few in numbers.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p25\"></a>The Communists in Germany, therefore, except in relatively insignificant regions, do not even dispose of the means to win the poor peasants. For the medium and small industries will surely not be expropriated. And it is practically the same, in the case of the four or five million poor peasants an France, and also for Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, and two of the Scandinavian countries. [I have no statistical data for Sweden and Spain.] Everywhere the small and medium industry prevails.. And even in Italy there is no absolute certainty; not to mention England, which counts only some one or two hundred thousand peasants.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p26\"></a>Neither will they be attracted by the promise that under Communism they will be exempt from rent-paying and mortgage-rent. For with Communism they see the approach of civil war, the loss of markets, and general destruction.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p27\"></a>Unless, therefore, there should come a crisis far more terrible than the present one in Germany, a crisis, indeed, far exceeding the horrors of any other crises that ever were before, the poor peasants in Western Europe will side with Capitalism, as long as it has any life left. [In the brochure, \u201cThe World Revolution,\u201d I have emphatically pointed out this difference between Russia and Western Europe. The development of the German Revolution has proved that my judgment was even too optimistic. In Italy it is possible that the poor peasants will side with the proletariat.]</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_6\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p28\"></a>Industrialists stand alone</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p29\"></a>The workers in Western Europe stand all alone. Only a very slight portion of the lower middle-class will help them. And these are of no significance economically. The workers will have to make the revolution all by themselves. Here is the great difference as compared to Russia.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p30\"></a>Possibly you will say, Comrade Lenin, that this was the case in Russia. There also the proletariat has made the revolution all by itself. It is only after the revolution that the poor peasants joined. You are right, and yet the difference is immense.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p31\"></a>You knew with absolute certainty that the peasants would come to you, and that they would come quickly. You knew that Kerensky would not, and could not give them the soil. You knew that they would not help Kerensky long. You had a magic charm, \u201cThe Soil to the Peasants,\u201d by means of which you would win them in the course of a few months to the side of the proletariat. We, on the other hand, are certain that for some time to come the poor peasants, all over Western Europe, will side with Capitalism.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p32\"></a>You will possibly say that, although in Germany there is no great mass of poor peasants whose assistance can be relied on, the millions of proletarians that side as yet with, the bourgeoisie are sure to come round. That, therefore, the place of the poor peasants in Russia, will here be taken by the proletarians, so that there is help all the same. This representation is also fundamentally wrong, and the immense difference remains.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p33\"></a>The Russian peasants joined the proletariat AFTER Capitalism had been defeated; but when the German workers that are now as yet on the side of Capitalism join the ranks of the Communists, the struggle against Capitalism will begin in real earnest.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p34\"></a>The revolution in Russia was terrible for the proletariat in the long years of its development \u2014 and it is terrible now, after the victory. But at the actual time of revolution it was easy, and this was due to the peasants.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p35\"></a>With us it is quite the contrary. In its development the revolution was easy, and it will be easy afterwards; but its actual coming will be terrible \u2014 more terrible, perhaps, than any other revolution ever was, for Capitalism, which in your country was weak and only slightly rooted as it were to feudalism, the middle ages, and even barbarism, here in our country is strong and widely organised and deeply rooted, and the lower middle classes as well as the peasants, who always side with the strongest, with the exception of a shallow and economically unimportant layer, will stand with Capitalism until the very end.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p36\"></a>The revolution in Russia was victorious with the help of the poor peasants. This should always be borne in mind here in Western Europe and all the world over. But the workers in Western Europe stand alone: this should never be forgotten in Russia.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p37\"></a>The proletariat in Western Europe stands alone. This is the absolute truth: and on this truth our tactics must be based. All tactics that are not based on this are false, and lead the proletariat to terrible defeat.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p38\"></a>Practice also has proved that these assertions are true, for the poor peasants in Western Europe have not only no programme and failed to claim the land, but they do not even stir now that Communism is approaching. As I have observed before, this statement is not to be taken absolutely literally. There are regions in Western Europe where, as we have mentioned before, landed property on a large scale is predominant, and where the peasants are therefore in favour of Communism. There are yet other regions where the local conditions are such that the poor peasants may be won for Communism. But these regions are comparatively small. Neither do I wish to imply that quite at the close of the revolution, when all things are coming down, there will be no poor peasants coming to our side. They undoubtedly will. That is why we must carry on an unceasing propaganda amongst them. Our tactics, however, must be adopted for the beginning and for the course of the revolution. What I mean is the general trend, the general tendency of conditions. And it is on these alone that our tactics must be based. [You, Comrade, will surely not try and win in an argument by taking the assertions of your opponent in too absolute a sense, as small minds do. My above remark, therefore, is meant for the latter.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p39\"></a>From this there follows in the first place \u2014 and it should be clearly, emphatically and plainly stated \u2014 that in Western Europe the real revolution, that is to say the overthrow of Capitalism, and the <i>erection and permanent institution of Communism</i>, for the time being is possible only in those countries where the proletariat BY ITSELF is strong enough against all the other classes \u2014 in Germany, England, and Italy, where the help of the poor peasants is possible. In the other Countries the revolution can only be prepared as yet by means of propaganda, organisation and fighting. The revolution itself can only follow when the economic conditions will be thus much shaken through the revolution in the big States (Russia, Germany, and England), that the bourgeois class will have grown sufficiently weak. For you will agree with me that we cannot base our tactics on events that may come, but that may also never happen (help from the Russian armies, risings in India, terrible crises, etc., etc.).</p>", "<p><a id=\"p40\"></a>That you should have failed to recognise this truth concerning the importance of the poor peasants, Comrade, is your first great mistake, and likewise that, of the Executive in Moscow and of the International Congress.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p41\"></a>What does it mean with regard to tactics, this fact that the proletariat of Western Europe stands all alone: that it has no prospect of any help whatsoever from any other class?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p42\"></a>It means, in the first place, that the demands made on the masses are far greater here than in Russia \u2014 that, therefore, the proletarian mass is of far greater importance in the revolution. And in the second place that the importance of the leaders is proportionately smaller.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p43\"></a>For the Russian masses, the proletarians, knew for certain, and already saw during the war, and in part before their very eyes, that the peasants would soon be on their side. The German proletarians, to take them first, know that they will be opposed by the entire Capitalism of Germany, with all its classes.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p44\"></a>It is true that already before the war the German proletarians numbered from nineteen to twenty millions of actual workers, on a population of seventy millions, but they stood alone against all the other classes. [Of course I had to take the pre-war ciphers, and have made the increase in proletarians after the last statistics (of 1909) to equal those previous.] They are opposed by a Capitalism that is immeasurably stronger than that of Russia \u2014 and they are UNARMED. The Russians were armed.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p45\"></a>From every German proletarian therefore, from every individual, the revolution demands a far greater courage and spirit of sacrifice than was necessary in Russia.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p46\"></a>This is the outcome of the economic class-relations in Germany, and not of some theory or idea risen from the brain of revolutionary romanticists or intellectuals!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p47\"></a>Unless the entire class or at least the great majority stand up for the revolution personally, with almost superhuman force, in opposition to all the other classes, the revolution will fail; for you will agree with me again that on determining our tactics we should reckon with our own forces, not with those from outside \u2014 on Russian help, for instance.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p48\"></a>The proletariat almost unarmed, alone, without help, against a closely united Capitalism, means for Germany that every proletarian must be a conscious fighter, every proletarian a hero; and it is the same for all Western Europe.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p49\"></a>For the majority of the proletariat to turn into conscious, steadfast fighters, into real Communists, they must be greater, immeasurably greater, here than in Russia, in an absolute as well as a relative sense. And once more: this is the outcome, not of the representations, the dreams of some intellectual, or poet, but of the purest realities.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p50\"></a>And as the importance of the class grows, the importance of the leaders becomes relatively less. This does not mean that we must not have the very best of leaders. The best are not good enough; we are trying hard to find them. It only means that the importance of the leaders, as compared to that of the masses, is decreasing.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p51\"></a>For you, who had to win a country of 160 millions, with the help of seven or eight millions, the importance of the leaders was certainly immense! To triumph over so many, with so few, is in the first place a matter of tactics. To do as you did, Comrade, to win such a huge land, with such small forces, but with assistance from outside, all depends in the first place on the tactics of the leader. When you, Comrade Lenin, started the struggle with a small gathering of proletarians, it was in the first place your tactics that in the crucial moments waged the battles and won the poor peasants.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p52\"></a>But what about Germany? There the cleverest of tactics, the greatest clearness, the genius of the leaders even, cannot attain much. There you have an inexorable class-enmity, one against all the others. There the proletarian class must turn the scales for itself \u2014 through its power, its numbers. Its power, however, is based above all in its quality, the enemy being so mighty and so endlessly better organised and armed than the proletariat.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p53\"></a>You opposed the Russian possessing classes, as David opposed Goliath. David was little, but he had a deadly weapon. The German, the English, the West-European proletariat oppose Capitalism as one giant does another. Between them all depends on strength \u2014 strength of body, and above all of mind.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p54\"></a>Have not you observed, Comrade Lenin, that in Germany there are no great leaders? They are all quite ordinary men. This points to the fact that this revolution must in the first place be the work of the masses, not of the leaders.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p55\"></a>To my idea this is something more wonderful and grand than has ever been, and it is an indication of what Communism will be.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p56\"></a>And as it is in Germany, it is in all Western Europe, for everywhere the proletariat stands alone.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p57\"></a>The revolution of the masses, of the workers \u2014 of the masses of workers alone, for the first time in the world.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p58\"></a>And not because thus it is good, or beautiful, or conceived in someone\u2019s brain, but because the economic and class-relations will it thus. [I do not touch here on the fact that <i>through this other</i> relation of numbers (20 millions to 70 millions in Germany!) the importance of the mass and the leaders, and the relation between mass, party and leaders, also in the course and at the close of the revolution, here, will differ from those of Russia.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p59\"></a>In other words, and to render the matter as clear as possible: the relation from the West-European to the Russian revolution can be demonstrated by means of the following comparison: \u2014 Supposing that in an Asiatic country like China or British India, where only one half per cent of the inhabitants are industrial proletarians, and 80 per cent, small peasants, a revolution should break out, and should be successfully carried through by those small peasants under the lead of the politically and socially more trained proletarians that were united in local trade unions and co-operatives. If these Chinese or Indian workers proclaimed to them: \u201cWe have won through our local trade unions and cooperatives, and now you must do the same with regard to your revolution,\u201d what would the Russian workers have replied? They would have said: \u201cDear friends, this is impossible. Our country is far more developed than yours. With us not all, but three per cent of the population are industrial proletarians. Our Capitalism is more powerful than yours therefore we need better and more powerful organisations than you did.\u201d</p>", "<p><a id=\"p60\"></a>In the same way as the Russians would have answered the Indians or Chinese, the workers of Western Europe, especially of England and Germany, must answer the Russians: \u201cWith us not three, but twenty per cent of the population are industrial proletarians. Our Capitalism is a hundred times stronger than yours. We therefore need better industrial organisations and far stronger Communist Parties than you had.\u201d</p>", "<p><a id=\"p61\"></a>From this difference between Russia and Western Europe there follows likewise: \u2014</p>", "<p><a id=\"p62\"></a>1. That, when you, or the Executive in Moscow, or the opportunist Communists of Western Europe, of the Spartacus League, or of the English Communist Party, say: \u201cIt is nonsense to fight about the question of leader or masses,\u201d that you in that case are wrong as regards us, not only because we are yet trying to find those leaders, but also because for you this question has quite another meaning.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p63\"></a>2. That when you say to us: \u201cLeader and mass must be one inseparable whole,\u201d you are wrong, not only because we are striving for that unity, but also because that question has another meaning for you than for us.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p64\"></a>3. That when you say: \u201cIn the Communist Party there should reign an iron discipline, and an absolute military centralisation,\u201d this is wrong, not only because we are seeking an iron discipline and strong centralisation, but also because this question has a different meaning for us and for you.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p65\"></a>4. That when you say: \u201cWe acted in such and such a way in Russia (after the Korniloff offensive for instance, or some other episode), or we went in Parliament in this or that period, or we stayed in the trade unions, and therefore the German proletariat must do the same,\u201d all this means absolutely nothing, and need not or cannot be applicable in any way. For the West-European class relations in the struggle, in the revolution, are quite different from those of Russia.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p66\"></a>5. That when you wish to force upon us tactics that were good in Russia \u2014 tactics, for instance, that were based, consciously or unconsciously, on the conviction that here the poor peasants will soon join the proletariat \u2014 in other words, that the proletariat does not stand alone \u2014 that your tactics, which you prescribe, and which are followed here, will lead the West-European proletariat into ruin, and the most terrible defeat.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p67\"></a>6. That when you, or the Executive in Moscow, or the opportunist elements in Western Europe, like the Central Board of the Spartacus League or the B.S.P., try to compel us to follow opportunist tactics (opportunism always seeks the support of foreign elements, that forsake the proletariat), you are wrong.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p68\"></a>The general bases on which the tactics in Western Europe must be founded are these: the recognition that the proletariat stands alone, that it is to expect no help, that the importance of the mass is greater, and that of the leaders relatively smaller.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p69\"></a>This was not seen by Radek when he was in Germany, nor by the Executive in Moscow, nor by you, as is evident from your words.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p70\"></a>And it is on these bases that the tactics of the Kommunistische-Arbeiter-Partei in Germany, the Communist Party of Sylvia Pankhurst, [So far, at least.] and the majority of the Amsterdam Commission, as appointed by Moscow, are founded.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p71\"></a>It is on these grounds that they strive, before all, to raise the masses as a whole, and the individuals to a higher level, to educate them one by one to be revolutionary fighters, by making them realise (not through theory only, but especially by practice), that all depends on them, that they are to expect nothing from foreign help, very little from leaders, and all from themselves.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p72\"></a>Theoretically, therefore, and apart from private utterances, minor questions and excresences, which, like those of Wolffheim and Laufenberg, are inevitable in the first phases of a movement, the view taken by these parties and comrades is quite right, and your opposition absolutely wrong. [It has struck me that in this controversy you almost invariably make use of private, and not public views of the opposition.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p73\"></a>On going from the East to the West of Europe, we traverse at a given moment an economic boundary. It runs from the Baltic to the Mediterranean, here from Danzig to Venice. This line divides two worlds. West of this line there is a practically absolute domination of the industrial, commercial and financial capital, united in the most highly developed banking capital. Even the agricultural capital is subject to, or has been compelled to unite with this capital. This capital is organised to the utmost degree, and converges in the most firmly established State Governments of the world. East of the line there is neither this gigantic development of industrial, commercial, transport and banking capital, nor its almost absolute domimiation, nor, consequently, the firmly established modern State.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p74\"></a>It would be marvellous, indeed, if the tactics of the revolutionary proletariat west of this boundary-line were the same as in the east!</p>"], "title": "I. Introduction", "idChr": "1.01"}, {"content": ["<p>\u00a0</p>", "<p><a id=\"p0\"></a>Having brought forward the general theoretic bases, I will now proceed to prove, also by practice, that the Left Wing in Germany and England is right in general principles \u2014 in the question of the Trade Unions and of parliamentarism. First we will take the question of the Trade Unions.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p1\"></a>\u201cAs parliamentarism embodies the spiritual, thus the Trade Union movement embodies the material power of the leaders over the masses of the workers. Under capitalism the Trade Unions constitute the natural organisations for uniting the proletariat, and as such Marx, already from the very beginning, has demonstrated their importance. Under a more developed capitalism, and to a greater extent even the age of imperialism, the Trade Unions have ever more become gigantic unions, with a trend of development, equal to that of the bourgeois State bodies themselves. They have produced a class of officials, a bureaucracy, that disposes of all engines of power of the organisation, the finances, the Press, the appointing of lower officials; often it is invested with even greater power, so that from a servant of the rank and file, it has become the master, identifying itself with the organisation. The Trade Unions can be compared to the State and its bureaucracy, also in this: that, notwithstanding the democracy that is supposed to reign there, the members are unable to enforce their will against the bureaucracy; every revolt is broken against the cleverly constructed apparatus of official ordnances and statutes, before it has been able even to shake the highest regions.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p2\"></a>It is only at the cost of the most tenacious perseverance that every now and then an organisation manages in the course of years to obtain a moderate result, which mostly remains restricted to a change of persons. In the last few years, before and after the war, in England, Germany, and America, this often gave rise to rebellions of the members, who started strikes on their own account, against the will of the leaders, or the decrees of the union itself. That this should seem natural, and is accepted as such, is an indication in itself that the organisation does not represent the total of the members, but something altogether foreign to them; that the workers do not have the control of their union, but that the union is placed over them an outward power against which they can rebel \u2014 a power which, all the same, has its origin in themselves: again, therefore, an analogy with the State. Once the revolt is over, the old domination begins again. In spite of the hatred and impotent exasperation of the masses, this domination manages to maintain itself, owing to the indefference and lack of clear insight, and of a united, indomitable will of the masses, and upheld as it is by the inner need of the Trade Unions, the only means the workers have to gain strength through unity, in their struggle against capital.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_7\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p3\"></a>Waning of Trade Union Influence</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>Fighting against capital, in a constant opposition against its tendencies of increased misery, and enabling the working class, through the restriction of these tendencies, to keep in existence the Trade Union movement, has played its part under capitalism, and has thus become itself a member of capitalist society. It is only at the beginning of revolution, when the proletariat, from a member of capitalist society, is turned into the annihilator of this society, that the Trade Union finds itself in opposition to the proletariat.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>\u201cThat which Marx and Lenin demonstrated for the State: that its organisation, in spite of formal democracy, renders it impossible to turn it into an instrument of the proletarian revolution, must also hold good therefore for the Trade Union organisations. Their counter-revolutionary power cannot be destroyed or weakened through a change of staff, through the replacing of reactionary leaders by radical or revolutionary elements.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>It is the form of organisation that renders the masses as good as powerless, and prevents them from turning the Trade Unions into the organs of their will. The revolution can triumph, only if it completely destroys this organisation: that is to say, if it alters the form of organisation so fundamentally as to turn it into something altogether different. The Soviet system, the construction from within, is not only able to uproot and abolish the State, but also the Trade Union bureaucracy: it will constitute not only the new political organs of the proletariat as opposed to capitalism, but likewise the foundation for the new Trade Unions. In the party factions in Germany, the idea of a form of organisation being revolutionary has been mocked at, because it is only the revolutionary sentiment, the revolutionary mind of the members, that matters. However, if the most important part of the revolution consists in the masses conducting their own concerns \u2014 the control of society and the production \u2014 then every form of organisation that does not allow the masses to rule and to guide for themselves, must needs be counter-revolutionary and harmful, and as such it must be replaced by another form, which is revolutionary in so far that it allows the workers to decide matters for themselves.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>Through their very nature the Trade Unions are useless arms for the West-European revolution! Apart from the fact that they have become tools of capitalism, and that they are in the hands of traitors, apart from the fact that through their nature they are bound to make slaves of the members, no matter what the leaders may be, they are also unfit for use generally.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_8\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p8\"></a>The Harder Task of Europe</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>The Trade Unions are too weak in the contest against the most highly-organised capital in Western-European States. These latter are powerful: the unions are not. To a great extent the Trade Unions are Professional Unions as yet, which cannot make a revolution, if it were for that fact alone. And in so far as they are industrial unions, they are not founded on the industries, on the workshops themselves, and are consequently weak. Also they are more unions for help than for fighting, dated as they do from the days of the small bourgeoisie. Even before the revolution, their organisation was already inadequate for the struggle; for the Revolution itself it cannot serve at all \u2014 in Western Europe. For the industries, the workers in the industries, make the revolution, not in the industries and profession, but in the workshops. Moreover, these unions are far too slow-working, conplicated instruments, good for the time of evolution only. Even if the revolution should not succeed right away, and we had once more to revert to peaceful action for a while, the Trade Unions would have to be destroyed and replaced by industrial unions, on a basis of industrial or workshop organisation. And with these miserable Trade Unions, that must be done away with in any case, they want to make the revolution!! The workers in Western Europe need WEAPONS for the revolution. The only weapons for the revolution in Western Europe are the <i>Industrial Organisations</i>. And these united into ONE big whole!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p10\"></a>The workers in Western Europe need the very best weapons. They stand alone: they have no help. And therefore they need these industrial organisations. In Germany and England they need them at once, because there the revolution is nearest at hand. The other countries must have them as soon as possible, as soon as we can erect them.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p11\"></a>It is no good at all, Comrade Lenin, your saying: In Russia we did it in such and such a way, for in the first place you had no organisations that were so inadequate for the struggle as many of the Trade Unions are here. You had industrial unions. Secondly, your workers were more revolutionary in spirit. Thirdly, the organisation of the capitalists was weak; and the State also. And in the fourth place, and this is the main point: you had help. You did not need the very best of weapons. We stand alone, we must have them. We will not win unless we have them. We will be defeated over and over again, unless we have them.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p12\"></a>Also other grounds, as well as material, prove this.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p13\"></a>Recall in your mind Comrade, how things were in Germany, before and during the war. The Trade Unions, the far too weak but only means, were entirely in the hands of the leaders, who used them as dead machines on behalf of capitalism. Then the revolution broke out. The Trade Unions were used by the leaders and the masses of members as a weapon against the revolution. It was through their help, through their co-operation, through their leaders, nay, partly even through their members that the revolution was murdered. The Communists saw their own brothers being shot with the co-operation of the Trade Unions. Strikes in favour of the revolution were prevented, rendered impossible. Do you hold it possible, Comrade, that under such conditions revolutionary workers should remain in those unions? Especially when these latter are utterly inadequate instruments for the revolution! In my opinion this is a psychical impossibility. What would you yourself have done, as member of a political party, that of the Menshevists for instance, if these had acted thus in the revolution? You would have split the Party (if you had not already done so before)! You will reply: This was a political party, it is different in the case of a Trade Union. I believe you are mistaken. In the revolution, during the revolution, every Trade Union, every workers\u2019 union even, is a political party \u2014 either pro- or counter-revolutionary.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p14\"></a>In your article, however, you say, and you will do so now: These emotional impulses must be conquered, for the sake of unity and Communist propaganda. I will show you, by means of concrete examples, that during the revolution this was impossible in Germany. For these questions must also be considered quite concretely. Let us suppose that Germany had 100,000 really revolutionary dock labourers, 100,000 revolutionary metal workers, and 100,000 revolutionary miners; that these were willing to strike, to light, to die for the revolution, and that the other millions were not. What are these 300,000 to do? They must in the first place unite, and form a fighting league. This you acknowledge. Without organisation workers can do nothing. Now a new league against old unions, even if the workers remain in the old ones, is a split already; if not formally, at any rate actually, in reality. Next, however, the members of the new league need a press, meetings, localities, a salaried staff. This requires heaps of money. And the German workers possess next to nothing. In order to keep the new league going, they must needs, whether they like it or not, leave the old one. Thus we see that, concretely considered, that which you, Comrade, proposes, is impossible.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_9\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p15\"></a>Build on New Foundations</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p16\"></a>However, there are better material grounds yet. The German workers who left the Trade Unions, that wished to destroy them, that created the industrial organisations and workers\u2019 unions, stood IN THE REVOLUTION. It was necessary to fight at ONCE. The revolution was there. The Trade Unions refused to fight. What is the good then of saying: Remain in the Trade Unions, propagate your ideas, you will grow stronger, and become the majority. Apart from the fact that the minority would bo strangled, as is the custom there, this would be quite fine, and also the Left Wing would try it, if there were only time to do so. But it was impossible to wait. The revolution had begun. And it is still going on!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p17\"></a>IN THE REVOLUTION (mind, Comrade, it was in the revolution that the German workers split the Party, and created their Workers\u2019 Union) the revolutionary workers will always separate themselves from the social-patriots. In the struggle, no other way is possible. No matter what you, and the Moscow Executive, and the International Congress say, and no matter how much you dislike a split in the Party, it will always take place, on psychic, and material grounds, because the workers cannot in the long run tolerate the Trade Unions to shooting them, and because there has to be fighting.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p18\"></a>That is why the Left Wing has created the Workers\u2019 Unions; and as they believe that the revolution in Germany is not over yet, but it will proceed to the final victory, they keep them up.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p19\"></a>Comrade Lenin, is there another way out, in the workers\u2019 movement, when two trends come up, but that of fighting? And when these trends are very divergent, if they oppose one another, is there another way but secession? Did you ever hear of any other? And is there anything more opposed than revolution and counter-revolution?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p20\"></a>For this reason again the K.A.P.D. and the General Workers\u2019 Unions are quite right.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p21\"></a>And, Comrade, have not these secessions, these clearances ever been a blessing for the proletariat? Does not this always become evident after a while? I have some experience in this matter. When we as yet belonged to the social-patriotic party we had no influence \u2014 after our expulsion we had some \u2014 in the beginning and very soon we won a great, a very great influence. And how about you, the Bolshevists, after the secession? I believe you fared quite well. Small influence at first, very much later on. And all now. It all depends on the economic and political development, whether a group, be it ever so small, does become the most powerful party. If the revolution in Germany lasts, there is a fair hope that the importance and the influence of the workers\u2019 unions will surpass all the others. You should not be intimidated by their numbers \u2014 70,000 against seven millions. Smaller groups than these have become the strongest \u2014 the Bolshevists, among others!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p22\"></a>The industrial unions and workshop organisations, and the Workers\u2019 Unions that are based on them and formed from them, why are they such excellent weapons for the revolution in Western Europe, the best weapons even together with the Communist Parties? Because the workers act for themselves, infinitely more so than they did in the old Trade Unions, because now they control their leaders, and thereby the entire leadership, and because they have the supervision of the industrial organisation, and thereby of the entire union.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p23\"></a>Every craft, every workshop is one whole, where the workers elect their representatives. The industrial organisations have been divided according to economic districts. For the districts representatives have been appointed.

Here the worker, every worker, has power, for in his workshop he elects his own foremen, and through them he has a direct control over district and State. There is a strong centralisation, but not too strong. The individual and the industrial organisation has great power. He can dismiss or replace his foremen at any time, and compel them to replace the higher positions at the shortest notice. This is individualism, but not too much of it. For the central corporations, the districts and government councils have great power. The individual and the central board have just that amount of power which this present period, in which the revolution breaks out, requires and allows.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p29\"></a>Marx writes that under capitalism the citizen is an abstraction, a cipher, as compared to the State. It is the same in the Trade Unions. The bureaucracy, the entire system of the organisation plane ever far above, and are altogether out of the reach of the worker. He cannot reach them. He is a cipher as compared to them, an abstraction. For then he is not even the man in the workshop. He is not a living, willing, struggling being. If in the old Trade Unions you replace the bureaucracy by other persons, you will see that before long these also have the same character; that they stand high, unattainably high above the masses, and are in no way in touch with them. Ninety-nine out of every hundred will be tyrants, and will stand on the side of tho bourgeoisie. It is the very nature of the organisation that makes them so.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p30\"></a>Your tactics strive to leave the Trade Unions as they are, \u201cdown below,\u201d and only to give them other leaders somewhat more of the Left trend, is therefore purely a change \u201cup above.\u201d And the Trade Unions remain, in <i>the power of leaders</i>. And these, once spoilt, everything is as of old, or, at the very best, a slight improvement in the layers up above. No, not even if you yourself, or we ourselves, were the leaders, we would not consent to this. For we wish to render the masses themselves to become more intelligent, more courageous, self-acting, more elevated in all things. We want the masses themselves to make the revolution. For only thus the revolution can triumph here in Western Europe.

This is felt, this is almost instinctively known by the most advanced workers of England (as we all feel it), and because they feel this, they have founded a new movement, which, whilst manifesting itself in various directions, and searching as yet, just as in Germany \u2014 is in general the rank and file movement, the movement of the masses themselves, without, or practically without leaders.

The way they are conducted dates from the time of the small struggle, as far back often as the 19th and even the 18th century.

You need not fear, we will have ample time!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p58\"></a>Once again this will be so, not because we of the Left Wing will it so, but because the revolution must needs have these new organisations.

The revolution in Western Europe can and must be organised only in the crafts and on a craft basis, because here capitalism has attained such a high economic and political organisation (in all directions) and because the workers (except for the Communist Party) have no other strong weapons.

All elements are now to be affiliated: the Trade Unions, the independents, the French Centre, parts of the Labour Party. To preserve the Marxistic semblance, conditions are put that have to be SIGNED, and Kautsky, Hilferding, Thomas, etc., are expelled.

It was such in the revolution of the Netherlands against Spain, in the English revolution, in that of France, in the Commune, and in the two Russian revolutions.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p75\"></a>In accordance with the development of the Labour movement, there are two trends here in the West-European revolution: the radical and the opportunist trend. These can only arrive at sound tactics, at unity, by means of a mutual struggle. The radical trend, however, though in some particulars it may go too far, is much the best. And yet you, comrade Lenin, go and support the opportunists!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p76\"></a>And not only this! The Executive in Moscow, the RUSSIAN leaders of a revolution that triumphed through the help of millions of poor peasants, forces their tactics on the proletariat of West-Europe, which stands and has to stand all alone, in so doing annihilates the best trend in Western Europe!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p77\"></a>What incredible foolishness, and especially what dialectics:</p>", "<p><a id=\"p78\"></a>When the revolution in Western Europe breaks out, it will work for you blue wonders! But the proletariat will be the victim.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_16\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p79\"></a>Counter-Revolutionary Trade Unions</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p80\"></a>You, Comrade, and the Executive in Moscow, know that the Trade Unions in Western Europe are counter-revolutionary forces. This is evident from your Theses. And yet you wish to retain them. You also know that the Workers\u2019 Union, the rank and file movement, are revolutionary organisations. You say yourself, in your Theses, that the industrial orgnisations must be and are our aim. And yet you want to smother them. You want to destroy organisations in which the workers, every worker and therefore the mass, can attain power and strenght, and to keep those in which the mass is a dead tool in the hands of the leaders. Thus you strive to bring the Trade Unions in your power, in the power of the Third International.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p81\"></a>Why is it you wish to do so? Why do you follow these bad tactics? Because you want masses around you, no matter of what kind, as long as they are masses. Because you believe that if only you have masses obeying you on account of a strict discipline and centralisation, no matter whether they are communistic, half communistic, or not communistic at all, you, the leaders, will win. In a word, because your tactics are leader-tactics.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p82\"></a>Leader-tactics are not those politics that want leaders and centralisation, for without these one attains nothing (they are as indispensable as the party), but it is those politics that collect masses, without inquiring into their convictions, their heart; politics that assume that the leaders, once they have great masses around them, will be able to win.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_17\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p83\"></a>Russian Tactics Useless in West Europe</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p84\"></a>But these politics, which you and the Executive are now following, will lead nowhere in Western Europe. Capitalism here is far too powerful as yet, and the proletariat stands too much isolated. These politics will fail here, just as those of the Second International did.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p85\"></a>Here the workers themselves must become strong, and, through them, their leaders. Here the evil, the leadership-policy, must be seized by the root.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p86\"></a>Through these your tactics in the Trade Union question you and the Moscow Executive have proved, to my idea, that UNLESS YOU SHOULD ALTER THESE TACTICS, YOU CANNOT CONDUCT THE REVOLUTION IN WESTERN EUROPE.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p87\"></a>You say that the Left Wing, in following its tactics, can only talk. Well, Comrade, in the other countries the Left Wing has had next to no opportunities as yet to act. But look at Germany, and the tactics and actions of the K.A.P.D. in the \u201cKapp putsch\u201d and with regard to the Russian revolution, and you will have to take those words back.</p>"], "title": "II. The Question of the Trade Unions", "idChr": "1.02"}, {"content": ["<p>\u00a0</p>", "<p><a id=\"p0\"></a>Next we have to take up the defence of the Left Wing in the question of Parliamentarism. [Originally I considered this a minor point. The attitude of the Spartacus League, however, at the time of the Kapp putsch, and your opportunist brochure, opportunist even in this question, have convinced me that it is of great importance.] The same universally-theoretical grounds that we dealt with for the Trade Unions, determine the attitude of the Left Wing also here. The fact that the proletariat stands alone, the gigantic force of the enemy, and consequently the necessity for the mass to raise itself to a much higher level, and to rely on its own support exclusively. I need not repeat these grounds here. Here, however, there arc a few more grounds than in the question of the Trade Unions.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_18\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p1\"></a>Subjects of Bourgeois Democracy</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p2\"></a>In the first place, the workers of Western Europe and the working masses in general are completely subjected, as far as ideas are concerned, to the bourgeois system of representation, to parliamentarism, to the bourgeois democracy. Much more so than the workers of Eastern Europe. Here the bourgeois ideology has taken a strong hold of the entire social and political life, it has penetrated far more into the heads and hearts of the workers. Here they have been brought up in that ideology for hundreds of years already. These ideas have altogether saturated the workers.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>These relations have been very finely depicted by Comrade Pannekock in the Viennese periodical, \u201cCommunismus\u201d: \u2014</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>\u201cThe experience of Germany places us face to face with the great problem of the revolution in Western Europe. In these countries the old bourgeois method of production, and the corresponding highly developed culture of many centuries have completely put their stamp on the thoughts and feelings of the masses. Consequently the spiritual and inner mind-character of the masses here is quite different from that of the Eastern countries, where they did not know this domination of bourgeois culture. And herein above all lies the difference in the progress of the revolution in the East and in the West. In England, France, Holland, Scandinavia, Italy and Germany, ever since the middle ages there has been a strong bourgeoisie, with a small-bourgeois, and primitively capitalistic production; whilst feudalism was defeated, an equally strong, independent peasantry sprang up in the country, which was master in its own small concern. On this soil the bourgeois civic spiritual life developed into a firm national culture, especially in the coast-lands of England and France, which were most advanced in capitalistic development. In the nineteenth century capitalism, by means of the subjection of the entire agriculture into its power, and the attraction of the most distant farms into the circle of its world-economy, has raised this national culture to a higher level, has refined it, and by means of its spiritual methods of propaganda, the Press, the school, and the Church, has beaten it firmly into the brains of the masses, as well of those masses it proletarised, attracted into the cities, as of those that were left on the land. This applies not only to the original countries of capitalism, but also, though in a somewhat modified form, to America and Australia, where the Europeans founded new States, and to the countries of Central Europe, that had so far been stagnant: Germany, Austria, Italy, where the new capitalist development could link itself to an old, obsolete, small-bourgeois economy, agriculture, and culture. In the Eastern countries of Europe capitalism found quite different material and other traditions. Here in Russia, Poland, Hungary, and the region east of the Elbe, there was no small, strong bourgeois class dominating the spiritual life since days immemorial; the primitive agrarian relations with, the landed property on a large scale, with patriarchal feudalism, and village Communism, determined the spiritual life.\u201d</p>", "<p><a id=\"p5\"></a>Here Comrade Pannekoek, in the ideological problem, has hit the nail on the head. Far better than it has ever been done from your side, he has demonstrated the difference between the east and the west of Europe, from an ideological point of view, and has given the cue towards finding the revolutionary tactics for Western Europe.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>This need only be combined with the MATERIAL causes of the power of our opponents, that is to say with the banking capital, and the tactics become perfectly clear.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_19\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p7\"></a>Workers Win Rights for Possessing Class</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>However, there is more to be said regarding the ideological problem yet: the civic freedom, the power of the parliament, has been won in Western Europe by means of the wars for liberty, waged by former generations, by the ancestors. And though at the time these rights were only for the citizens, for the possessing class, they were won by the people all the same. The thought of these struggles is to this day a deeply-rooted tradition in the blood of this people. Revolutions are ever the deepest memories of a people. Unconsciously the thought that it meant a victory to be represented by a parliament lias a tremendous, silent force. This is especially the case in the oldest bourgeois countries, where long or repeated wars have been waged for freedom: in England, Holland, and France. Also, however, though on a smaller scale, in Germany, Belgium, and the Scandinavian countries. An inhabitant of the East cannot realise, perhaps, how strong this influence can be.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>Moreover the workers themselves have fought here, often for years, for universal suffrage, and have thus obtained it, directly or indirectly. This also was a victory, which bore fruit at the time. The thought and the feeling, that it is a progress and a victory, to be represented, and to entrust their own representatives with the care of one\u2019s affairs in Parliament, prevails generally. The influence of this ideology is enormous.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p10\"></a>And, finally, reformism has brought the working-class of Western Europe altogether into the power of the parliamentary members, who have led it into war, and into alliances with capitalism. This influence of reformism is colossal also.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p11\"></a>All these causes have made the worker the slave of Parliament, to which he leaves all action. He himself does not act any longer. [This great influence, this entire ideology of the West of Europe, of the United States and the British colonies, is not understood in Eastern Europe, in Turkey, the Balkans, etc. (to say nothing of Asia, etc.).]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p12\"></a>Then comes the revolution. Now he has to act for himself. Now the worker, alone with his class, must fight the gigantic enemy, must wage the most terrible fight that ever was. No tactics of the leaders can help him. Desperately the classes, all classes oppose the workers, and not one class sides with them. On the contrary, if he should trust his leaders, or other classes in parliament, he runs a great risk of falling back into his old weakness of letting the leaders act for him, of trusting parliament, of persevering in the old notion that others can make the revolution for him, of pursuing illusions, of remaining in the old bourgeois ideology.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p13\"></a>This relationship of the masses to the leaders also has been excellently characterised by Comrade Pannekoek: \u2014</p>", "<p><a id=\"p14\"></a>\u201cParliamentarism is the typical form of the light by means of leaders in which the masses themselves play but a minor part. Its practice consists in this: that representatives, individual persons, carry on the actual lighting. With the masses it must therefore awaken the illusion that others can do the fighting for them. Formerly the belief was that the leaders could obtain important reforms for the workers through parliament; many have even had the illusion that the members of parliament, by means of laws and regulations, could carry out the transition towards Socialism. Today, since parliamentarism acts in a more honest way, the argument is heard that the representatives may do great things in parliament for the propaganda of Communism. Ever again the importance of the leaders is emphasised, and it is only natural that professionals should decide about politics; be it then in the democratic guise of congress discussions and resolutions. The history of Social Democracy is one series of fruitless attempts to let the members determine their own politics. Wherever the proletariat goes in for parliamentary action, all this is inevitable, as long as the masses have not yet created the organs for self-action; as long, therefore, as the revolution has not broken out. As soon as the masses can act for themselves, and can consequently determine, the disadvantages of parliamentarism become paramount.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p15\"></a>The problem of the tactics is how to eradicate in the proletariat mass the traditional bourgeois way of thinking that saps its strength; everything which strengthens anew the traditional view is wrong. The most firmly rooted, most tenacious part of this mental attitude is dependence on the leaders, to whom it leaves the decision in all general questions, and the control of all class matters. Parliamentarism has the inevitable tendency to crush in the masses the activity needed for the revolution. No matter what fine speeches are delivered to inspire the workers to revolutionary deeds, revolutionary action does not spring from such words, but from the keen and hard necessity that leaves no other choice whatsoever.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_20\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p16\"></a>Demands of the Revolution</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p17\"></a>The revolution also demands something more than the fighting-action of the masses that causes the overthrow of a government system, and which, as we know, is not at the command of the leaders, but only can proceed from the deep-felt impulse of the masses. The revolution requires that the great questions of social reconstruction shall be taken in hand, that difficult decisions shall be made, that the entire proletariat be roused to one creative pulse; and this is only possible if first the advance guard, and then an ever greater mass takes things in hand \u2014 a mass that is conscious of its responsibilities, that searches, propagates, fights, strives, reflects, considers, dares and carries out. All this, however, is hard and toilsome: therefore, as long as the working-class imagines there is an asier way, that of letting others act for it by jurying on an agitation from a high tribune, by taking decisions, by giving signals for action, by making laws, it will hesitate, and the old ways of thinking and the old weaknesses will keep them passive.\u201d</p>", "<p><a id=\"p18\"></a>The workers of Western Europe, let it be relented a thousand and, if need be a hundred thousand or a million times \u2014 and whoever has not, since November, 1918, learnt and seen it is blind \u2014 the West European workers must in the first place act for themselves \u2014 in the Trade Unions and also politically, and they must let their leaders act, because the orkers stand alone, and because no clever tactics of leaders can help them. The greatest impetus must come from them. Here, for the first time, to a far higher degree than in Russia, THE LIBERATION OF THE WORKERS MUST BE THE WORK OF THE WORKERS THEMSELVES. That is why comrades of the Left Wing are right in saying to the German comrades: Leave the elections alone, and boycott parliament \u2014 politically you must do everything for yourselves \u2014 you can not win unless you know this and act up to it \u2014 you cannot win unless you do so for two, five, or ten years; unless you train yourself to it man by man, group after group, from town to town, from province to province, and finally the entire land, as a party, a union; as industrial councils, as a mass, and as a class. You cannot win unless finally, through incessant training and incessant fighting, and through defeat, you advance to that stage, the great majority among you, where you can do all this, and where, at last, after all this schooling, you constitute one united mass.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p19\"></a>And that is why the comrades of the K.A.P.D. were right, perfectly right \u2014 history demanded it of them \u2014 at once to proceed to a secession, to split Trade Unions; as this covers the entire political question, there is an urgent need for the fight, the example, the lead.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_21\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p20\"></a>An Example Needed</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p21\"></a>But these comrades of the Left Wing, the K.A.P.D., would have committed a grave mistake had they done nothing but preach and propagate this. Here even more, perhaps, than in the case of the party, when the Spartacus League, or rather the Spartacus Zentrals, refused to stand this propaganda of theirs. For what the German slaves, what all workers of Western Europe needed in the first place, was an example. In this nation of political slaves, and in this subjected West European world, there had to be a group, that gave the example, of free fighters without leaders, that is to say, without leaders of the old type \u2014 without members of parliament.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p22\"></a>And once again all this must be, not because it is so beautiful, or good, or heroic, but because the German and West European proletariat stands alone in this terrible fight, without help from any other class, because the cleverness of the leaders is of no avail any longer, because there is but one thing that is needed, the will and firmness of the mass, man for man, woman for woman, and of the mass as a whole.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p23\"></a>For this higher motive, and because the opposite tactics, parliamentary action, can but harm this higher cause, infinitely high as compared to the small profit of parliamentary propaganda, for this higher motive the Left Wing rejects parliamentarism.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p24\"></a>You say that Comrade Liebknecht, if he yet lived, might work wonders in the Reichstag. We deny it. Politically he could not manoeuvre there, because all the bourgeois parties oppose us on one united front. And he could win the workers no better in parliament than outside it. On the other hand, the masses, to a very great extent, would leave everything to be done through his speeches, so that his parliamentary action would have a harmful effect. [The example of Comrade Liebknecht is in itself a proof that our tactics are right. BEFORE the revolution, when imperialism was as yet at the summit of power, and suppressed every movement by martial law, he could exercise an enormous influence through his protests in parliament; DURING the revolution this was so no longer. As soon, therefore, as the workers have taken their lot in their own hands, we must let go of parliamentarism.]</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_22\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p25\"></a>Big Numbers of no avail</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p26\"></a>It is true that this work of the Left Wing would take years, and those people who for some reason or other, strive for immediate results, big numbers, large amounts of members and votes, big parties, and a powerful (seemingly powerful!) International, will have somewhat long to wait. Those, however, who realise that the victory of the German and West European revolution can only come, if a very great number; if the mass of the workers believe in themselves, will be satisfied with these tactics.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p27\"></a>For Germany and Western Europe they are the only tactics possible. This holds good particularly for England.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p28\"></a>Comrade, do you know the bourgeois individualism of England, its bourgeois liberty, its parliamentary democracy, as they have grown during some six or seven centuries? Do you really know them? Do you know how utterly they differ from conditions in your country? Do you know how deeply these ideas are rooted in everyone, also in the proletarian individuals of England and its colonies? Do you know into what an immense whole it has developed? Do you know how generally spread it is? In the social and personal life? I do not think there is one Russian, one inhabitant of Eastern Europe, who knows them. If you knew them, you would rejoice at these among the English workers who totally break with this greatest political formation of all capitalism in the world.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p29\"></a>If this is done with full consciousness, it demands a revolutionary mind, quite as great as that which once broke with Czarism. This rupture with the entire democracy of England constituted the era of the English revolution.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p30\"></a>And this is done, as it must inevitably be done in England, with its tremendous history, tradition, and strength; it is done with the utmost firmness of purpose. Because the English proletariat has the greatest power (potentially it is the most powerful on the earth), it makes a sudden stand against the mightiest bourgeoisie of the earth, and with one stroke rejects the entire English democracy, although the revolution has not yet broken out there.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p31\"></a>That is what their advance guard did, just like those of Germany, the K.A.P.D. And why did they do it? Because they know that they also stand alone, and that no class in all England will help them, and that before all the proletariat itself, and not the leaders, must fight and win there. [It is true that England has no poor peasants to support capital. But the middle class is only the greater, and is united with capitalism.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p32\"></a>By means of this advance guard the English proletariat shows how it wants to fight: alone, and against all classes of England and its colonies.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p33\"></a>And, exactly like Germany again: by giving the example. By founding a Communist Party that rejects parliamentarism, and that calls out to the entire class in England: Let go of parliament, the symbol of capitalist power. Form your own party and your own industrial organisations. Rely on your own strength exclusively.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p34\"></a>This had to be so in England, Comrade; it had to come in the long run. This pride and courage, born out of the greatest capitalism. Now that it comes at last, it comes in full force at once.]</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_23\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p35\"></a>A Great Day</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p36\"></a>It was an historic day, Comrade, when on this June day in London the first Communist Party was founded, and this Party rejected the entire structure and government apparatus of seven hundred years. I wish Marx and Engels could have been present there. I believe they would have felt a great, a supreme joy at seeing how these English workers rejected the English State, the example for all States of the earth, and which for centuries has been the centre and stronghold of world-capitalism and rules over one-third of humanity; how they reject it and its parliament, though only theoretically as yet.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p37\"></a>These tactics are all the more necessary in England because English capitalism supports the capitalism of all other countries, and will decidedly not scruple to summon auxiliaries from all over the world, against every foreign, as well as against its own proletariat. The fight of the English proletariat, therefore, is a struggle against world-capital. All the more reason for the English Communists to give the most elevated and brillwant example. To wage an exemplary fight on behalf of the world-proletariat, and to strengthen it by its example. [In England, more even than elsewhere, there is always a great danger of opportunism. Thus also our Comrade Sylvia Pankhurst, who from temperament, instinct and experience, not so much from deep study perhaps, but by mere chance, was such an excellent champion of Left Wing Communism, seems to have changed her views. She gives up anti-parliamentarism, and consequently the cornerstone of her fight again opportunism, for the sake of the immediate advantage of unity! By so doing she follows the road thousands of English Labour leaders have gone before her: the road towards subjection under opportunism and all it leads to, and finally under the bourgeoisie. This is not to be wondered at. But that you, Comrade Lenin, should have induced her to do so, should have persuaded her, the only fearless, consequential leader in England, this is a blow for the Russian, for the World revolution.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p38\"></a>One might ask why I defend anti-parliamentarism for England, whereas above I have recommended it only for those countries where the revolution has broken out. The answer must be that in the struggle it may often prove necessary to go one step so much to the Left. If in a country so diseased with opportunism as England, the danger should arise of a young Communist Party falling back into the course of opportunism, through parliamentarism, it is a tactical necessity to defend the anti-parliamentarism. And thus in many countries of Western Europe it may continue to be!]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p39\"></a>Thus there has to be everywhere one group that draws all the consequences; such groups are the salt of humanity.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p40\"></a>Here, however, after this theoretic defence of anti-parliamentarism, I have to answer in detail your defence of parliamentarism. You defend it (from page 36 to 68), for England and Germany. The argumentation, however, holds good only for Russia (and at the very utmost for a few other East-European countries), not for Western Europe. That, as I have said before, is where your mistake lies. That turns you from a Marxist into an opportunist leader. That causes you, the Marxist, radical leader for Russia, and probably a few more East European countries, to sink back into opportunism where Western Europe is concerned. And, if accepted here, your tactics would lead the entire West to perdition. This I will next prove in detail, in answer to your argumentation.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p41\"></a>Comrade, on reading your argumentation from page 36 to 68, a recollection was constantly recurring to me.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_24\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p42\"></a>Amongst the Social Patriots</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p43\"></a>I saw myself once more at a congress of the old Social-Patriotic Party of Holland, listening to a speech of Troelstra\u2019s \u2014 a speech in which he depicted to the workers the great advantages of the reformistic policy, in which he spoke of the workers that were not social-democratic as yet, and that were to be won, by compromise; in which he spoke of the alliances that were to be made (only provisionally, of course!) with the parties of these workers, and of the \u201crifts\u201d in and between the bourgeois parties, of which we were to make use. In just the same way, in almost, nay in absolutely the same words, you, Comrade Lenin, speak for us West Europeans!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p44\"></a>And I remember how we sat there, far back in the hall: we, the Marxist Comrades, very few in number \u2014 only four or five. Henriette Roland Holst, Pannekoek, and a few others. Troelstra spoke persuasively and convincingly, just as you do, Comrade. And I remember how, in the midst of the thundering applause, of the brilliant reformistic expositions and the reviling of Marxism, the workers in the hall looked round at the \u201cidiots\u201d and \u201casses\u201d and \u201cchildish fools,\u201d such as at that time Troelstra called us \u2014 such, almost, as you call us now. To all probability things have been practically the same at the Congress of the International in Moscow, when you spoke against the \u201cLeft\u201d Marxists. And his words \u2014 just as yours, Comrade \u2014 were so convincing, so logical, within the compass of his method, that at times even I myself thought, yes, he is right.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p45\"></a>Usually I was the one to speak for the opposition (in the years up to 1909, when we were expelled). Shall I tell you what I did, when I began to doubt, about myself? I had a means that never failed me: it was a sentence out of the Party Programme: \u2014</p>", "<p><a id=\"p46\"></a>\u201cYou shall ever act or speak in such a way that the class-consciousness of the workers shall be roused and strengthened.\u201d</p>", "<p><a id=\"p47\"></a>And I asked myself: Is the class-consciousness of the workers roused or not by what the man over there is saying? And then I always knew at once that this was not the case, and that therefore I was right.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p48\"></a>It was quite the same on reading your brochure. I hear your opportunist arguments for co-operation with non-Commuudst parties, with bourgeois elements, for compromise. And I am carried away. It all seems so brilliant, clear and fine. And so logical also. But then I consider, as I used to do long ago, just one phrase, which some time ago I had made for myself, for the campaign against the Communist opportunists. It is as follows: \u2014 Is what yonder comrade says of such a nature that it strengthens the will of the masses for action, for the revolution, for the real revolution in Western Europe \u2014 yes or no? And with regard to your brochure, my head and heart answer at the same time: No. Then I know at once, as surely as one can possibly know anything, that you are wrong.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p49\"></a>This method I can recommend to the comrades of the Lefi Wing.

The advantages of parliamentary propaganda for winning the workers and the petit bourgeois elements to our side.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p54\"></a>2. The advantage of parliamentary action for making use of the \u201crifts\u201d between the parties, and for compromises with some of them.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p55\"></a>3. The example of Russia, where this propaganda and the compromise worked so wonderfully well.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p56\"></a>Further arguments you have none. I will answer them in turn.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p57\"></a>To begin with the first argument, the propaganda in parliament. This argument is of very slight importance. For the non-communistic workers, that is to say the Social-Democrats, the Christian and other bourgeois elements do not, as a rule, read one word in their papers about our parliamentary speeches.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p58\"></a>Often these speeches are utterly mutilated.

Only a speech of Comrade Levi in parliament was lacking as yet! Had he but delivered this speech, they would have come to us, instead of to the double-minded Independents! No, comrade, this is not true. They have gone to the double-minds first as they were afraid as yet of the one-minded: the revolution. Because the transition from slavery to freedom lies through hesitation.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p64\"></a>Look out, Comrade, you see whither opportunism is already leading you.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p65\"></a>Your first argument is of no importance.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p66\"></a>And if we consider that parliamentary action (in the revolution, an Germany and England, and all Western Europe) abets the workers in his idea that their leaders will do things for them, and dissuades them from the idea that they must do everything for themselves, we see that this argument does not only bring no good at all, but that it is exceedingly harmful.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p67\"></a>The second argument: the advantage of parliamentary action (in revolutionary periods) for profiting of the rifts between the parties, and for compromises with some of them.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_27\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p68\"></a>An Uncongenial Task</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p69\"></a>To refute this argument (especially for England and Germany, but also for all Western Europe), I shall have to go somewhat more into detail than with the first. It is most uncongenial to me, Comrade, that I should have to do this against you. This entire question of revolutionary opportunism, for it is no longer reformistic, but revolutionary opportunism) is a vital question, literally a matter of life and death for us West-Europeans. The matter itself, the refutation, is easy. We have refuted this argument a hundred times, when Troelstra, Henderson, Bernstein, Legien, Renaudel, Van de Velde, etc., all the Social-Patriots, used it. Why Kautsky, when he was still Kautsky, has refuted it. It was the greatest argument of the reformists. We did not think we would ever have to do it against you. Now we have to. Well then:</p>", "<p><a id=\"p70\"></a>The advantage of profiting in parliament by the \u201crifts\u201d is utterly insignificant, for the very reason that since a few years, since a score of years, those \u201crifts\u201d have become so insignificant. Those between the big-bourgeois and the petty-bourgeois parties. In Western Europe, in Germany and England. This does not date from the revolution. It was so long before, in the period of peaceful evolution. All parties, also the petty-bourgeoisie and the small peasants, had been AGAINST the workers for a long time already, and between themselves the difference in matters concerning the workers (and consequently on nearly all points), had become very slight, or had often quite disappeared.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p71\"></a>This is an established fact, theoretically as well as practically. In Western Europe, in Germany and England.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p72\"></a>Theoretically, because capital concentrates in banks, trusts, and monopolies to an enormous degree.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p73\"></a>In Western Europe, and especially in England and Germany, these banks, trusts and cartels have assimilated nearly all capital in the industries, commerce, transport, and to a great extent even in agriculture. The entire industry, small scale industry also, the entire transport, also the small enterprises, the entire commerce, big as well as small, and the greater part of agriculture, great and small, has consequently become absolutely dependent on the great-capital. They have become one with it.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p74\"></a>Comrade Lenin says that the small commerce, transport, industry and agriculture, waver between capital and workers. This is wrong. It was so in Russia, and it used to be so here. In Western Europe, in Germany and England, they are now so largely, so utterly dependent on the great capital, that they waver no longer. The small shopowner, the small industrial, the small trader, are absolutely in the powers of the trusts, the monopolies, the banks. It is from these that they get their goods and credit. And even the small peasant, through his co-operative and mortgages, is dependent on the trust, the monopoly, and the banks.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p75\"></a>Comrade, this part of my argumentation, the argumentation of the \u201cLeft Wing,\u201d is most important of all. The entire tactics for Europe and America depends upon it.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p76\"></a>What elements do they consist of, Comrade, these lower layers that stand nearest to the proletariat? Of shop-owners, artisans, lower officials and employees, and of poor peasants.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p77\"></a>Let us consider what these are in Western Europe! Follow me, comrade. Not only in a big one \u2014 there the dependence on capital is a matter of course \u2014 but in a small shop in a poor, proletarian quarter. Look around you. What do you see? Everything: nearly all the goods, clothes, foodstuffs, implements, fuel, etc., are products not only of the big industry, but often of the trusts. And not only in the cities, but in the country likewise. The small shopkeepers are for the greater part storekeepers of the great capital. That is to say of the banking-capital, for this rules the great factories, the trusts.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p78\"></a>Look about you in the workshop of a small artisan, no master whether in the city or in the country. His raw material, the metals, the leather, the wood, etc., come to him from the great-capital, often even from the monopolies, that is to say from the banks also. And in so far as the purveyors are small capitalists as yet, these in their turn depend on the banking-capital.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p79\"></a>And the lower officials and employees? The greater majority of them in Western Europe is in the employ of the great-capital, the State, of the municipality, finally also of the banks, therefore. The percentage of employees and officials nearest to the proletariat, that are directly or indirectly dependent on the great-capital, is very great in Western Europe. In Germany and England, as also in the United States and the British colonies, it is enormous.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p80\"></a>And the interests of these layers are one therefore with those of the great-capital, that is to say of the banks.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p81\"></a>The poor peasants I have already dealt with, and we have seen, that for the time being they cannot be won for Communism, for the reasons already mentioned, and also because they are dependent on the great-capital for their implements, goods, and mortgages.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p82\"></a>What does this prove, Comrade?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p83\"></a>That the modern West-Enropean (and American) society and State have become ONE big, organised, thoroughly organised whole, which is entirely controlled, moved and regulated by the banking-capital. That society here is a regulated body, capitalistically regulated, but regulated all the same. That the banking-capital is the blood, flowing through the entire body, and nourishing all its branches. That this body is one, aud that the capital renders this body enormously strong, and that therefore all the members will stand by it to the very end \u2014 all except the proletariat, which makes this blood the surplus-value.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p84\"></a>Through this dependence of all classes on, the banking-capital and through the enormous strength of the banking-capital, all the classes are hostile to the revolution, so that the proletariat stands alone.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p85\"></a>And as the banking-capital is the most pliable and elastic force in the world, and increases its power a thousand times through its credit, it upholds and maintains capitalism and the capitalist State, also after this terrible war, after the loss of thousands of milliards, and in the midst of conditions that to us seem like bankruptcy.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p86\"></a>And it is through this that, with all the more force, it collects all classes around it, combining them into one whole, against the proletariat. And the force and pliability, and the unison of all classes are so great, that they will last long after the revolution has broken out.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_28\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p87\"></a>Cause of Revolution\u2019s Delay</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p88\"></a>It is true that capital has been terribly weakened. The crisis is coming, and with it the revolution. And I believe that the revolution will win. But there are two causes that are still keeping capitalism very strong. Those are the spiritual slavery of the masses, and the banking-capital.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p89\"></a>Our tactics, therefore, have to be based on the force of these two.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p90\"></a>And there is one other cause through which the organised banking-capital rallies all the classes against the revolution. It is the great number of proletarians. All the classes feel that if only they could induce the workers (in Germany alone almost twenty millions) to work 10, 12, or 14 hours a day, that then there would be a way out of the crisis. That is also why they hold together.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p91\"></a>These are the economic conditions in Western Europe.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p92\"></a>In Russia the banking-capital did not have this power yet, so that there the bourgeois and the lower classes did not unite. Between those there were real \u201crifts\u201d consequently. And there the proletariat did not stand alone.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p93\"></a>These economic causes determine politics. It is through this that those classes in Western Europe (dependent slaves as they are) vote for their masters, for these great-bourgeois parties, and that they belong to them. In Germany and England, in Western Europe, these elements have hardly any parties of their own.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p94\"></a>All this was very strong already before the revolution and before the war. Now through the war it has become intensified to an enormous extent \u2014 through nationalism and chauvinism, but especially through the gigantic trustification of all economic forces. Through the revolution, however, this tendency \u2014 unity of all bourgeois parties with all petty-bourgeois elements and all poor peasants \u2014 has again been immensely strengthened.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p95\"></a>The Russian Revolution has not been in vain! Now we know everywhere what we have to expect.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p96\"></a>Thus in Western Europe, and especially in England and Germany, the big bourgeoisie and the big peasants, the middle classes and middle peasants, the lower bourgeoisie and the small peasants, are all united against the workers, through the monopoly, the banks, the trusts; through imperialism, the war, the revolution. [It is true that through the war an infinitely greater number of various elements has come down to the ranks of the proletariat. All elements, though as good as any element that is not proletarian, clings desperately to capitalism, and if need be will defend it by armed force, being hostile to Communism.] And, as the labour-question encompasses all things, they are united on all questions.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p97\"></a>Here, Comrade, I must make the same remark I have already made with regard to the peasant question (in the first chapter). I know quite well that the little minds in our Party, that miss the strength to base the tactics on great, general lines, and consequently base them on the small, particular ones, that these little minds will call the attention to those elements among these layers, that have not yet come under the ban of the great-capital.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p98\"></a>I do not deny that there are such elements, but I maintain that the general truth, the general tendency in Western Europe is that they are under the ban of the great-capital. And on this general truth our tactics must be based!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p99\"></a>Neither do I deny that there may be \u201crifts\u201d yet. I only say that the general tendency is, and will be, for a long time after the revolution: unity of these classes. And I say that for the workers in Western Europe it is better to have their attention directed to that unity than to these rifts. For it is they themselves that must in the first place make the revolution, and not their leaders, their Members of Parliament.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p100\"></a>Nor do I say that (which the little minds will make of my words) that the real interests of these classes are the same as those of the great-capital. I know that these classes are oppressed through it.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p101\"></a>What I say is solely this:</p>", "<p><a id=\"p102\"></a>These classes cling to the great-capital even more firmly than before, because now they also see the danger of the proletarian revolution ahead.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p103\"></a>In Western Europe the dominion of capital means to them a more or less sure existence, the possibility of or at least the belief in a betterment of their position. Now they are threatened by chaos and the revolution, which for some time to come means a worse chaos. That is why they side with capital in the effort to lift the chaos by every possible means, to save the production, to drive the workers to longer working hours, and to greater patience in privation. For them the proletarian revolution in Western Europe is the fall and breaking down of all order, of all security of existence, be it then ever so insufficient. Therefore they all support the great-capital, and will continue to do so for a long time, also during the revolution.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_29\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p104\"></a>All Classes Fight the Proletariat</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p105\"></a>For finally I must yet point out that what I have said applies to the tactics at the beginning and in the course of the revolution. I know that quite at the end of the revolution, when the victory draws near, and capitalism has been shattered, these classes will come to us. But we must determine our tactics not for the end, but for the beginning and in the course of the revolution.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p106\"></a>Theoretically, therefore, all this had to be so. Theoretically these classes had to co-operate. Theoretically this is an ascertained fact. But practically also.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p107\"></a>This I will prove next:</p>", "<p><a id=\"p108\"></a>For many years already the entire bourgeoisie, all bourgeois parties in Western Europe, also those that belong to the small peasants and middle bourgeoisie, have done nothing for the workers. And they were all of them hostile to the labour movement, and in favour of imperialism, of the war.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p109\"></a>For years already there had not been a single party in England, in Germany, in Western Europe, that supported the workers. All were opposed to them; in all matters. [I lack the space here to point this out in detail. In a brochure, \u201cThe Basis of Communism\u201d, I have done so at length.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p110\"></a>There was no new labour legislation. Conditions grew worse instead. Laws were passed against striking. Ever higher taxes were levied.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p111\"></a>Imperialism, colonisation, marinism and militarism were supported by all bourgeois, also the small-bourgeois parties. The difference between liberal and clerical, conservative and progressive, great-and small-bourgeois, vanished.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p112\"></a>Everything which the social-patriots, the reformists said, about the difference between the parties, about the \u201crifts\u201d between them, was a fraud. And all this has now been brought forward by you, Comrade Lenin! It was a fraud for all countries of Western Europe. This has been best proved in July-August 1914.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p113\"></a>At that time they were all one. And the revolution has made them even far more united in practice. Against the revolution, and conseqently against all workers for the revolution alone can bring actual betterment to all workers, against the revolution they all stand together without one single \u201crift.\u201d</p>", "<p><a id=\"p114\"></a>And as through the war, the crisis and the revolution, all social and political questions have come to be connected in practice with the question of the revolution, these classes in Western Europe stand together in all questions, and in opposition to the proletariat.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p115\"></a>In a word, the trust, the monopoly, the big banks, imperialism, the war, the revolution, have, also in practice, riveted together into one class all the great- and small-bourgeoisie and peasant parties of Western Europe, against the workers. [We Hollanders know this only too well. We nave seen the \u201crifts\u201d disappear before our eyes, in our small, but, through our colonies, highly imperialistic country. With us there are no longer democratic, Christian, or other parties. Even the Dutch can judge of this better than a Russian, who, I regret to say, seems to judge Western Europe after Russia.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p116\"></a>Theoretically and practically, therefore, this is an ascertained fact. In the revolution, in Western Europe, and especially in England and Germany, there are no \u201crifts\u201d of any considerable importance between these classes.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p117\"></a>Here again I must add something personal. On pages 40 and 41 you criticise the Amsterdam Bureau. You cite a thesis of that bureau. Parentethically, what you say with regard to this is wrong \u2014 all of it. But you also say that the Amsterdam Commission, before condemning parliamentarism, ought to have given an analysis of the class relations and the political parties, to justify this condemnation. Excuse me, Comrade, this was not the task of the Commission. For that on which their thesis is based, to wit that all bourgeois parties in Parliament as well as more outside, had been all along, and even now, were opposed to the workers, and did not show the slightest \u201crift,\u201d all this had been ascertained long ago, and was an established fact for all Marxists. In Western Europe at least, there was no need for us to analyse that.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p118\"></a>On the contrary, considering you strive for compromise and alliances in Parliament, which would lead us into opportunism, it was your duty to demonstrate that there are any rifts of importance between the bourgeois parties.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p119\"></a>You wish to lead us, here in Western Europe, into compromising. What Troelstra, Henderson, Scheidemann, Turati, etc., could not accomplish in the time of evolution, you wish to do during the revolution. You have to prove that this can be done.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_30\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p120\"></a>Opposing Capitalist Forces unite to defeat Revolution</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p121\"></a>And this not by means of Russian examples; these are easy enough, to be sure, but with West-European examples. This duty you have fulfilled in the most miserable way. No wonder you took almost exclusively your Russian experience, that of a very backward country, not that of the Western Europe, of these modern days.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p122\"></a>In the entire booklet, which deals with these very questions of tactics, the Russian examples excepted, to which I will soon proceed, I find but two examples from Western Europe: the Kapp putsch in Germany, and the Lloyd George\u2014Churchill Government in England, with the opposition of Asquith.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p123\"></a>Very few examples indeed, and of the poorest nature, that there are \u201crifts\u201d between the bourgeois, and in this case also the social-democratic parties!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p124\"></a>If ever a proof were needed that between the bourgeois (and in this case also the social-democratic parties), there are no important rifts as towards the workers, in the revolution, and here in Western Europe; the Kapp putsch furnishes that proof. The Kappites did not punish, kill and imprison the democrats, the Zentrum people, and the social-democrats! And when these came into power again, they did not punish, kill and imprison the Kappites. But both parties killed the Communists!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p125\"></a>Communism was too weak as yet. That is why they did not TOGETHER make a dictatorship. Next time, when Communism will be stronger, they will make a dictatorship BETWEEN THEM.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p126\"></a>It was and is your duty, Comrade, to point out in what way the Communists could at that time have taken advantage in Parliament of that rift (?) \u2014 in such a way, of course, as to benefit the workers. It was and is your duty to tell us what the Communist Members of Parliament ought to have said to make the workers see this rift, and take advantage of it \u2014 in such a way, of course, as not to strengthen the bourgeois parties. You cannot do this, because in the revolution there is no rift of any importance. And it is of the time of the revolution that we speak. And it was your duty to point out that if in special cases there should be such rifts, it would be more advantageous to direct the attention of the workers in that direction than to the general tendency towards unity.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p127\"></a>And it was and is your duty, Comrade, before beginning to lead us, in Western Europe, to show where those rifts are, in England, in Germany, in Western Europe.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p128\"></a>This you cannot do either. You speak of a rift between Churchill, Lloyd George, and Asquith, of which the workers are to take advantage. This is altogether pitiful. This I will not even discuss with you. For everyone knows that since in England the industrial proletariat has some power, these rifts have been artificially made by the bourgeois parties and leaders and are yet being made, to mislead the workers, to entice them from the one side to the other, and back again ad infinitum, thus to keep them for ever powerless and dependent. To this end they even at times admit two opponents to the one government, Lloyd George and Churchill. And Comrade Lenin lets himself be caught in this trap, that is well nigh a century old! He strives to induce the British workers to base their politics on this fraud! At the time of the revolution, the Churchills, Lloyd Georges, and Asquiths will unite against the revolution, and then you, Comrade, will have betrayed and weakened the English proletariat with an illusion. It was your duty to point out not by means of general, fine and brilliant figures of speech (as in the entire last chapter, on page 72 for instance), but accurately, concretely, by means of clear examples and facts, what those conflicts and differences are \u2014 not the Russian ones, nor those that are of no importance, or artificially made \u2014 but by means of the actual, important, West-European examples. This you do nowhere in your brochure. And as long as you do not give these, we do not believe you. When you give them we will answer you \u2014 until then we say: It is nothing but illusions that mislead the workers, and lead them into false tactics. The truth is, Comrade, that you wrongly assume the West-European and the Russian revolution to be alike. And through what reason? Because you forget that in the modern, that is to say West-European and North American States, there is a power that stands above the various kinds of capitalists \u2014 the landowners, industrial magnates, and merchants: the banking-capital. This power, which is identical with imperialism, unites all capitalists, including the small peasants and bourgeois.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p129\"></a>One thing, however, remains to you. You say there are rifts between Labour parties and the bourgeois parties, and that these can be made use of. This is right.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p130\"></a>We might aver, to be sure, that these differences between the social-democrats and bourgeois in the war and in the revolution have been very slight and have disappeared in most cases! But they might be there. And they may arise yet. Of those we must therefore speak. Especially as you bring forward the \u201cpure\u201d English Labour Government, Thomas Henderson, Clynes, etc., in England, against Sylvia Pankhurst, and the possibly \u201cpure\u201d socialistic government of Ebert, Scheidemann, Noske, Hilferding, Crispien, Cohn, against the K.A.P.D. [It is yet the question whether these \u201cpure\u201d Labour Governments will come here. Maybe that here again you let yourself be misled by the Russian example \u2014 Kerensky. In the following lines I will point out why in this case, in the March days in Germany, this \u201cpure\u201d socialistic Government was not to be supported all the same.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p131\"></a>You say that your tactics, which direct the workers\u2019 attention towards these Labour Governments, encouraged them to promote their formation, is clear and profitable; whilst ours, which is opposed to their formation, is harmful.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p132\"></a>No, Comrade, our attitude with regard to these cases of \u201cpure\u201d Labour Government, where the rift between these parties of workers and those of the bourgeoisie become a split, is again quite clean and profitable, to the revolution.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p133\"></a>It is possible that we shall allow such a Government to exist. It can be needful, it can mean a progress of the movement. If this is so, if we cannot proceed any further yet, we will let them exist, criticising them as keenly as possible, and replace them by a Communist Government as soon as we can. But to promote its coming in Parliament and through the elections, this will not do in Western Europe.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p134\"></a>And we will not do this, because in Western Europe and in the revolution the workers stand all alone. For that reason everything \u2014 do you understand this? \u2014 everything HERE depends on their will for action, on their clearness of brain. And because these, your tactics of compromising with the Scheidemanns and Hendersons, with the Crispiens and their followers among the English Independents, of the opportunist Communists of the Spartacus League or the B.S.P. \u2014 because these tactics inside and outside of Parliament confuse the heads, here in Western Europe and in the revolution \u2014 making the workers elect someone of whom they know beforehand to be an impostor, and because our tactics on the other hand render them clearsighted, by showing them the enemy as enemy, because of all this and, even at the risk of losing a representative in Parliament in periods of illegality, or of missing the benefit of a \u201crift\u201d (in Parliament!), we in Western Europe, and under the present conditions, choose our tactics and reject yours.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p135\"></a>Here again your advice leads to confusion, and awakens illusions.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p136\"></a>But, what about the members of the social-democratic parties, the German Independents, the Labour Party, and the Independent Party? Must not those be won?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p137\"></a>These, the working and small-bourgeois elements among them, will be won by us, the Left Wing, in Western Europe, through our propaganda, our meetings and press, and especially through our example, our slogans, our action in the crafts. In revolution, those who are not won thus, through press, through our action, through the revolution, are lost anyway, and may go to the devil. These social-democratic, Independent Labour Parties in England and Germany consist of workers and small-bourgeois elements. The first, the workers, can all be won in the long run. The small-bourgeois elements only to a very slight extent, and these are of little importance economically; these few will be won over by our propaganda, etc. The majority of them \u2014 and it is on these that Noske and his conjurers rely above all \u2014 belong to capitalism, and, in proportion as the revolution advances, they rally all the closer around it.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_31\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p138\"></a>Workshop, not Parliament, the Battle-ground</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p139\"></a>But does the fact that we do not support them at the elections imply that we are cut off from the Labour Parties, the Independents, the social-democrats, the Labour Party, etc. On the contrary, we seek alliance with them as much as we can. On every occasion we summon them for common action: for the strike, the boycott, for revolt, street fights, and especially for the workers\u2019 councils, the industrial councils. We seek them everywhere. Only not in parliament, as we used to do. This, in Western Europe, belongs to a past epoch. But in the workshop, in the union and in the street \u2014 that is where we find them. That is where we win them. This is the new practice, following on the social-democratic methods. It is the Communist practice.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p140\"></a>You, Comrade, wish to bring the social-democrats, the Independents, etc., into Parliament, in order to show that they are deceivers. You wish to use Parliament to show that it is of no use.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p141\"></a>You seek slyly to deceive the workers. You put the rope round their neck and let them hang. We help them to avoid the rope. We do this because here we are able to do so. You follow the tactics of the peasant races; we those of the industrial races. This is no scorn, and no mockery. I believe that with you it was the right way. Only you should not \u2014 either in this small matter, or in the great question of parliamentarism \u2014 force on us what was good in Russia but leads to destruction here.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p142\"></a>Finally I have only one remark to make: You say, and you have often upheld it, that in Western Europe the revolution can only begin AFTER these power classes next to the proletariat have been sufficiently shaken, neutralised or won over. As we have demonstrated that they cannot be shaken, neutralised or won at the beginning of the revolution, this latter, if your statement would be just, were impossible. This has been observed to me over and over again, from your side, and also Comrade Zinoviev. Fortunately, however, here also your observation in this most important of questions which is to determine the revolution, is false. And it again proves that you see all things exclusively from the East-European point of view. I will make this clear in the last chapter.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p143\"></a>I herewith believe to have proved that your second argument for parliamentarism is for the greater part an opportunistic fraud, and that in this respect parliamentarism must now be replaced by another method of fighting, one that lacks its drawbacks and possesses greater advantages.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p144\"></a>I recognise that in this one point your tactics can have some advantages. The Labour Government can lead to some good, to greater clearness. Also in illegal times your tactics can be profitable. We recognise that. But just as once we had to say to the revolutionists and reformists: prize the development of self-consciousness in worker above everything, even above small advantages. We now say to you, Lenin and your \u201cRight\u201d comrades: We prize above all the ripening of the masses towards will and deed. Hereto all things have to be made subservient in Western Europe. We will see who is right, the \u201cLeft\u201d or \u2014 Lenin. I do not doubt one moment. We will defeat you, as we did Troelstra, Henderson, Renaudel and Legien.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p145\"></a>This here is the place to discuss the mutual relationship between party, class, and mass in Western Europe.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p146\"></a>This matter also is of the greatest importance: as important as the power of the Banking Capital, and the UNITY of all great and small bourgeois classes it engenders. The relation between party, class and mass in Western Europe differs widely from that of Russia, and like the unitv of the bourgeois classes it is due to the power of the banking-capital.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p147\"></a>Our tactics must be directed towards and based on a true realisation of that relationship. Whosoever does not understand this relationship, cannot understand the tactics of Western Europe.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p148\"></a>Let us again take Germany for an example. Not only because, with England, it is industrially the most highly developed country, but also because it offers the most developed statistics.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p149\"></a>As we have often observed already, it has a proletariat of about twenty millions of actual workers: about fourteen millions industrially and some six millions agriculturally. What does this mean? That, counting the children, the non-workers, and the aged, this proletariat comprises at least half \u2014 and probably more \u2014 of the total population of Germany.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p150\"></a>We have seen, however, that in the revolution the proletariat stands alone, and that the opponents of the proletariat, of the revolution, by virtue of their arms and their organisation, even to this day are so powerful that they can only be conquered by means of the unity of the entire proletariat. And through the banking-capital their power is such that unity alone does not suffice: that a conscious, determined unity, a truly Communist unity is needed.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p151\"></a>Two facts therefore are certain: the proletariat is very numerous, it comprises more than half the population; and, the opposition, in spite of this, is so powerful that the unity of the proletariat, the real Communist unity is needful.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p152\"></a>Thus only can Capitalism be overthrown, and can the revolution conquer.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p153\"></a>What follows from these two facts?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p154\"></a>Firstly, that the dictatorship of a Party, of a Communist Party, cannot exist here, in Germany, as it did in Russia, where a few thousands dominated the proletariat. Here the dictatorship, in order to conquer capital, must be exercised by the class itself, the entire class. [The Russian Communist Party at the time of Yudenitch\u2019s and Denikin\u2019s attacks, numbered 13,287 men, not one ten-thousandth part of the population of 150 millions. Through special weeks of propaganda the number, until January, 1920, increased to 220,000. Now it is no more than 600,000, 52 per cent of which are workers.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p155\"></a>It is not, we insistently repeat, for any radical, romantic, aesthetic, heroic or intellectual reason, but for the most simple and real fact, one moreover that is only too much felt by the German proletariat: that the highly organised German monopolistic banking-capital is so powerful, and unites the entire bourgeoisie.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p156\"></a>This same cause that unites the entire bourgeoisie renders it necessary that also the entire class should exercise the dictatorship.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_32\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p157\"></a>A United Proletariat necessary</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p158\"></a>From the above-named causes there follows, secondly: That in the beginning and during the course of the revolution [the masses] are hostile to the greater two parts. By masses we mean the proletariat and the other working classes combined.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p159\"></a>These latter (small bourgeois, peasants, intellectuals, etc.) in the beginning and during the course of the revolution are hostile to the greater part of the proletariat. Between the proletariat on the one side and the rest of the masses on the other, there is an antithesis. Class and mass in Western Europe are not one, nor can they become so at the start, and in the first stages of the revolution.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p160\"></a>Finally from the numerical relations of the proletariat towards the other classes, and from this fact that the proletariat must be united in order to win, there follows, as I have proved above, that the relative importance of the class, over against the power of the leaders, must be very great; that the power of the leaders, with regard to that of the class, must be small, and likewise that in all likelihood in Germany the power cannot come into the hands of some few leaders. If we consider the character of the German industry, its concentration in great numbers of centres, this goes without saying. How great, how numerous the leadership will be, cannot as yet be ascertained \u2014 it can only be stated that it will be extended over a great number of persons.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p161\"></a>And thus, after Germany, it is in the first place in England \u2014 and, though in a lesser degree, all over Western Europe.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p162\"></a>And this fact that the entire class must exercise the dictatorship, how does it affect the Communist Party?</p>", "<p><a id=\"p163\"></a>From this fact it ensues that the task of the Communist Party in Western Europe consists almost exclusively in preparing the class and rendering it conscious for the revolution and the dictatorship.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p164\"></a>In all its actions and all its tactics the Party must ever bear in mind that the revolution must be made, and the dictatorship exercised not by the Party alone, but by the class.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p165\"></a>This task can only be fulfilled if the Communist Party consists of politically truly conscious and convinced revolutionaries, who are ready for any deed, any sacrifice, and if all the half and wavering elements are kept off by means of its programme, by the action, and especially by the very tactics.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p166\"></a>For only thus, only by preserving this purity, the Party will be able to render the class truly revolutionary and communistic, through its propaganda, its slogans, and by taking the lead in all actions. The Party can take the lead only by being always absolutely pure itself.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p167\"></a>It cannot be defined beforehand how large the Communist Party will become through this action. We desire, of course, that it may be as big as possible. But the entire tactics and the entire struggle must be dominated by this principle: Better a thousand members that are good, than a hundred thousand that are bad. For these latter cannot accomplish the revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p168\"></a>It all depends on the purity and the firmness of the Communist Party, how far its power will reach, and in how far it will influence the masses. Also the quality of the leaders depends in some measure on its tactics.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p169\"></a>In other words, Comrade Lenin, we must follow the tactics you have followed in 1902 and 1903, when you formed the Party that has made the revolution.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_33\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p170\"></a>Menshevist Tactics would ruin Proletariat</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p171\"></a>All the social democrats of Russia at that time were of opinion that there ought to be erected a proletarian organisation, and they agreed that this organisation was to be obtained by means of a blind imitation of the German social-democracy; all this has finally crystallised into the Menshevist Party. The later Menshevists dreamed of the erection of a big Labour Party, in which the masses would be able to find the road to their action. Such a party would have to accept all those who adopted its programme, it would have to be democratically conducted, and would find its revolutionary way by means of free criticism, and free discussion. It was against this alluring image, Comrade Lenin, that you directed all the blows of your criticism, and not only because a similar party was impossible under Czarism, and an illusion, but mainly because \u201cbehind this illusion there lurked the immense opportunistic danger.\u201d The tactics of the Menshevists would mean that the most wavering and hesitating elements would obtain a decisive influence on the party of the proletariat. This you wished to prevent, and that is why you took care that the programme (in the well known first article), and the tactics also, should ever be such that this was impossible. [The quotations are from Radek.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p172\"></a>As you did then, we of the Left Wing wish to do now in the Third International. Through our very programme and tactics we wish to chase away all wavering and opportunistic elements; we only wish to accept the truly communistic, truly revolutionary ones, we wish to carry on a truly communistic action. And all this exclusively with a view of inspiring the entire class with the communist spirit, and of preparing it for the revolution and the dictatorship.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p173\"></a>This latter, the preparation is, of course, a process \u2014 a process of inter-action. Every action, every partial revolution advances the class, brings it nearer to the party, and the stronger class means greater strength for each new struggle, and also for the party. Thus party and class come into ever closer contact, and finally they grow into one whole.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p174\"></a>This, therefore, is our purpose: The Party, small or big, does everything in its power to further the ripening of the class for revolution and dictatorship, as this class stands alone in the revolution, without the help of other peasants.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p175\"></a>However, there is yet another means to obtain this. Besides the political party we have, as our weapon the Arbeiter-Union, based on the industrial organisation. What the party is in the political the Union is in the economic action.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p176\"></a>And just as the numerical and class relations for Germany and Western Europe, which I have quoted, clearly demonstrate that the party cannot exercise the dictatorship, so these figures, these class-relations, this unity of all bourgeois classes against the revolution, this inevitable unity of the proletariat to oppose them, and this necessity of the entire class exercising the dictatorship, and becoming for the greater part communistic, demonstrate the iron necessity that no Trade Union, no Arbeiter Union or Industrial League, or I.W.U. or Shop Stewards\u2019 Movement can ever presume to exercise the dictatorship.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p177\"></a>They, both of them, party as well as Arbeiter Union, each in its own sphere, and with every possible mutual support, must do all they can to prepare the class. For the time being, Party and Union are separate as yet. For, like all Trade Unions, the Union also has to fight for small improvements, and is therefore constantly exposed to opportunist and reformist influences. Only a truly communistic party can subordinate all things to the revolution.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p178\"></a>From the necessity of this development in Western Europe (which has sprung up through the power of the banking-capital), it is also clearly evident, that those who already now in the beginning and the course of the revolution wish to place the Arbeiter-Union, the Industrial Union, the industrial organisation, above the Party, or who even wish to abolish the latter, are wrong.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p179\"></a>Gradually, as the Party grows stronger, as the Union grows, as the class becomes more and more communistic, as the revolution approaches its goal, class, party, and Arbeiter-Union or Industrial Union come very near to one another. In the end the Party, the Union and the class are all equivalent, and are blended into one whole.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p180\"></a>Finally, of course, the power and the unity of all bourgeois classes, and the necessary unity of the entire proletariat, render a strong centralisation and a strict discipline, in the Party as well as in the Union, absolutely necessary.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p181\"></a>It. is the task of the German and English, the West-European and American proletariat to combine centralisation and discipline with the strictest control of, with the power over the leadership.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p182\"></a>For only thus, through this blending of centralisation in the leadership, and under the control of the members, the West-European and American proletariat can conquer.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p183\"></a>It need hardly be explained here, that also after the revolution the dictatorship of the entire class, and the communistic spirit of the entire proletariat in Western Europe and America are absolutely necessary. For here the counter-revolution is so powerful, that in case these two conditions were not fulfilled \u2014 in case, for instance, a new class of rulers sprang up, out of the intellectuals and the bureaucracy, so that corruption reigned \u2014 the revolution would soon perish. Now already the tactics must be on the watch to prevent this.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p184\"></a>How different from Russia, all this!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p185\"></a>How different from Russia, where, through the economic conditions, through the class relations \u2014 and rightly, therefore \u2014 a handful of people rule the Party, where an infinitesimally small party rules the class, and a minutely small class the entire nation; where no Arbeiter-Union is needed, where the class, and the great majority of the remaining working masses, the small peasants, were one in the revolution!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p186\"></a>Whoever fails to understand from the productive and class-relations of Western Europe what the relations between the leaders, the party, the class and the mass are, does not understand a thing of the revolution in Western Europe, nor of its necessary stipulations. Whoever wishes to conduct the West-European revolution according to the tactics and by the road of the Russian revolution, is not qualified to conduct it.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_34\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p187\"></a>The Left Wing Tactics</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p188\"></a>From these West-European, and to some extent also from the American and Anglo-Colonial relations, it is therefore perfectly evident that, there is only one kind of tactics that in West Europe (and North America) can lead to the victory, and those are the tactics of the Left Wing, in the name of which I am speaking. For these claim that the leaders, as compared to the classes, shall have relatively little power, and the class a relatively far greater power. These say that for the time being the class and the rest of the masses cannot be one. These claim that the entire class shall become truly communistic, through a truly Communist propaganda, that therefore party and class shall become one. These, in order to obtain that end, wish to destroy the bourgeois Trade Unions, and replace them by communistic industrial organisations, thus rendering also those organisations, the substitutes for the Trade Unions, the greatest of class organisations (in Germany they number over ten millions of proletarians already), equal to the class. These are against parliamentarism, thus rendering every worker, and consequently the entire proletariat, independently revolutionary, which is to say communistic.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p189\"></a>They, the Left party, act in perfect accordance therefore to the class relations as they actually are in Western Europe, and are entirely in the right over against the Executive Committee, the Congress of the Third International, and over against you, Comrade Lenin.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p190\"></a>Only quite recently you said to a British delegation that in England a quite small Communist Party would be able to accomplish the revolution. Here, again, you speak as a Russian, and judge things by the Russian example. And it is on such mistaken notions that the tactics of the Executive and of the International are based! [I here point out the contradiction between this opinion and the effort of winning millions of wavering elements for the Third International. This contradiction is another proof for the opportunism of your tactics.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p191\"></a>Those, however, who thank, and say, and propagate these views, do not understand a thing about the class relations in Western Europe and North America. [A very strong proof of how the Board of the Third International judges all things from the Russian standpoint, is the following: After the German revolution had been beaten down, after the Bavarian and the Hungarian revolutions had been crushed, Moscow said to the German and the Hungarian proletariat: \u201cBe comforted, and bear up, for in March and July, 1917, we also were defeated; but in November we won. As it went with us, it will go with you.\u201d And to be sure, this time again Moscow is saying the same to the Czecho-Slovakian workers. But the Russians have won in November exclusively because then the poor peasants did no longer support Kerensky! Where, Oh Executive Committee, are the millions of poor peasants in Germany, Bavaria, Hungary, and in Czecho-Slovakia? There are none. Your words are just utter nonsense. The perniciousness of these Moscow tactics, however, does not lie solely in that they console the workers by means of a false image, but more especially in the fact that they fail to draw the right conclusion from the defeat in Germany, Bavaria, Hungary and Czecho-Slovakia. The lesson they teach is this: \u201cDestroy your Trade Unions, and form industrial unions, thus rendering your Party and your class strong internally.\u201d Instead of this Lesson, however, we only hear: \u201cIt will go with you as it did with us!\u201d Is it not high time that against these tactics of Moscow, all over Western Europe there should arise one firmly organised, iron opposition? It is a question of life and death for the world-revolution itself. And also for the Russian revolution.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p192\"></a>To these observations I need only add that where I speak of the unity of party and class, that is attained at last, and of the possibility of the entire proletariat in Western Europe and America becoming communistic, I mean as big as possible a unity, and a great part of the proletariat. I represent the total Unity and the entire proletariat as the Ideal, as the goal towards which we must tend, as the aim of our tactics. To all probability it will be impossible and unnecessary to completely achieve it. But the unity of party and class, and the portion of the proletariat that has to become communistic, are so immeasurably greater here than in Russia, that the ideal in the tactics must be brought to the front. [With regard to this we must bear in mind that here we are always speaking of a disarmed proletariat. If, through some reason or other: through a new war, or later on, in the course of the revolution, the proletariat should once more obtain the arms, the above-named conditions do not count.]</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_35\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p193\"></a>Lenin\u2019s Third Arguments</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p194\"></a>Next I come to your third argument: the Russian examples. You mention them repeatedly (on pp. 1\u20149 they occur several times). I have read them with the greatest attention, and, as I admired them before, I do now. I have been on your side ever since 1903. Also when I did not know your motives as yet \u2014 the connections being cut off \u2014 as at the time of the Brest-Litovsk peace, I defended you with your own motives. Your tactics were certainly brilliant for Russia, and it is owing to these tactics that the Russians have triumphed. But what does this prove for Western Europe? Nothing, according to my idea, or very little. The Soviets, the dictatorship of the proletariat, the methods for the revolution and for the reconstruction, all this we accept. Also your international, foreign tactics have been \u2014 so far at least \u2014 exemplary. But for your tactics for the countries of Western Europe it is different. And this is only natural.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p195\"></a>How could the tactics in the East and West, of Europe possibly be the same? Russia, a country chiefly of agriculture, but with an industrial capitalism that was only partially highly developed, and very small as compared to the land. And fed, moreover, to a great extent by foreign capital! In Western Europe, and especially in England and Germany, it is just the opposite. With you: all the old-fashioned forms of capital yet, from the usury capital upwards. With us: almost exclusively a highly developed banking-capital. With you: immense remains of the feudal and pre-feudal times, and even out of the times of the tribe of barbarism. With us, and especially in England and Germany: all things, agriculture, commerce, transport, industry, in the ban of the highest developed capitalism. With you: immense remains of serfdom, the poor peasants, and in the country a declining middle class. With us: even the poor peasants in relation with modern production, transport, technique and exchange. And in the city as well as in the country the middle-class, also the lowest layers, in direct contact with the great-capitalists.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p196\"></a>You still have classes with which the rising proletariat can unite. The very existence of these classes helps. The same applies, of course, to the political parties. And with us, nothing of all this.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p197\"></a>Of course the compromising in all direction, as you so captivatingly describe it, this making use of the rifts even between the Liberals and the land-owners, was good with you. With us it is impossible. Consequently, the difference in tactics \u2014 in the East, and the West. Our tactics fit our conditions. They are just as good as yours were under Russian conditions.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p198\"></a>I find your Russian examples especially on pages 12 13 26 27 37 40 51 and 52. But no matter what these examples may mean for the Russian Trade Union question (page 27), for Western Europe they mean nothing at all, as here the proletariat needs far stronger weapons. As far as parliamentarism is concerned, your examples have been token from a period when the revolution had not broken out (pp. 16, 26, 41 and 51, for instance), and these, therefore, either do not apply to the point in question, or in so far as you could use the parties of the poor peasants and small bourgeoisie, they are so different from conditions here (pp. 12, 37, 40, 41 and 51), as to mean nothing for us. [To deal with all these Russian examples would be too monotonous. I request the reader to read them all over. He will see that what I have said above is right.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p199\"></a>It seems to me, Comrade, that your utterly wrong judgment, the utterly mistaken conception of your book, and no less the tactics of the Executive in Moscow, are to be attributed exclusively to the fact that you do not know enough about relations over here, or rather that you fail to draw the right conclusions from what you know, that you judge things too much from the Russian point of view.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p200\"></a>This means, however \u2014 and it should be emphasised here once again, as the fate of the West-European proletariat, the world-proletariat, the world-revolution depend on this \u2014 that neither you, nor the Executive of Moscow, as long as you adhere to these tactics, are able to direct the West-European, and consequently the World Revolution.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p201\"></a>You ask: Is it possible that you, who wish to reform the world, cannot even form a fraction in parliament?</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_36\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p202\"></a>Labour Movement in False Grooves</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p203\"></a>We answer: This book of yours is a proof in itself that whoever tries to do the latter is bound to lead the Labour movement into false grooves, into ruin.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p204\"></a>The book deludes the workers of Western Europe by means of illusions, of the impossible: compromise with the bourgeois parties in the revolution.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p205\"></a>It makes them believe in something that does not exist: the possibility of the bourgeois parties being divided in Western Europe, in the revolution.

This book is to the communistic revolutionary proletariat what Bernstein\u2019s book has been for the pre-revolutionary proletariat. It is your first book that is not good.

The sharpest criticism of the parliamentary delegates is necessary in that case. Other comrades, I believe, are of a different opinion.]</p>", "<p><a id=\"p209\"></a>Thus the conclusion to be drawn from all these arguments about parliamentarism, is as follows: Your three arguments for parliamentarism mean either very little, or they are wrong. And, as in the Trade Union question, your tactics also on this point are disastrous for the proletariat.

The freedom of speech will be suppressed, and all good Communists expelled.

Remember, also, that soon the U.S.P. will enter the Third International, and numerous other Centre parties besides!

You did sanction the attitude of the K.P.D.\u2014Zentrale, that offered loyal opposition to Ebert, Scheidemann, Hilferding and Crispien, but you evidently did not know, at the time of writing the brochure, that this happened in the same moment, in which Ebert collected the troops against the German proletariat, in which the universal strike was still spread all over Germany, and in which the great majority of the Communist mass strove to bring the revolution if not to the victory (perhaps this was hardly possible as yet), but at any rate to a higher strength. Whilst the mass, by means of strikes and armed revolt, conducted the revolution into a further stage (there has never been any anything more hopeful or gigantic than the revolt in the Ruhr region, and the general strike), the leaders offered parliamentary compromises. In so doing they supported Ebert against the revolution in the Ruhr region. [Comrade Pannekoek, who thoroughly knows Germany, had predicted this. If the leaders of the Spartacus League would be placed before the choice between Parliament and Revolution, they would choose Parliament.] If ever an example proved how damnable the use of parliamentarism is in the revolution, it is this one.

It has received the K.A.P.D. with threats, and has pandered to the central parties, as the U.S.P. But it did not demand of the Italian Party that it should expel the Zentrale which, through its offer, was partly responsible for the murdering of Communists in the Ruhr region. It did not demand of the Dutch Party that it should expel Wynkoop and van Reversteyn, who during the war, offered Dutch ships to the Entente. This does not mean to say that I myself wish those comraples to be expelled. On the contrary, I hold them to be good comrades, who have gone wrong only because the development, the beginning of the West-European revolution, is so terribly difficult. We, all of us over here, will make many big mistakes as yet. Moreover, the expulsion at present, in this International, would be of no avail.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p17\"></a>I only point this out to demonstrate by another example how fiercely opportunism is raging already in our own ranks. For the Moscow Central Committee has committed this injustice against the K.A.P.D. only, because for her opportunistic world-tactics it did not want the really revolutionary elements, but the opportunistic Independents, etc. On purpose it has used the tactics of Wolfheim and Lauffenberg against the K.A.P.D., although it knew that the K.A.P.D. did NOT agree with these tactics \u2014 for the most miserably opportunistic of reasons. Because it wants to have masses round it, like the Trade Unions and the political parties, no matter whether those masses are communistic or no.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p18\"></a>Two more other sections of the Third International prove clearly whither it is drifting. The first is the discharge of the Amsterdam Bureau, the ONLY group of revolutionary Marxists and theoreticians in Western Europe, that has never wavered. The second action, which is almost more serious, is the treatment of the K.A.P.D., the ONLY party in Western Europe which, as an organisation, as a whole, from its very origin upward, has conducted the revolution as it should be conducted. Whilst the Centre parties, the Independents, the French and English Centre, that ever betrayed the revolution, were allured by all possible means, the K.A.P.D., the real revolutionaries, were treated as enemies. Those are bad signs, Comrade.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p19\"></a>In a word: the Second International is still alive, or again alive, in our midst. And opportunism leads to ruin. And because this is so, and because opportunism is very strong amongst us, far stronger that I could ever have imagined, the Left Wing has to be there. Even if there should be no other good reasons for its existence, it would have to be there as opposition, to counter-balance opportunism.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p20\"></a>Alas, Comrade, if only you had followed the tactics of the Left Wing in the Third International; those tactics, that are nothing but the \u201cpure\u201d tactics of the Bolshevists in Russia, adapted to the West-European (and North-American) conditions!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p21\"></a>If only, as stipulations and statutes for the Third International, you had proposed and carried through the economic organisation in industrial organisations and workers\u2019 unions (into which, if need be, industrial unions on a craft basis might have been introduced), and the political organisation into parties with the rejection of parliamentarism!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p22\"></a>Then you would in the first place have had, in all countries, absolutely firm kernels, parties that could really carry out the revolution, parties that would gradually have gathered the masses around them, through their own example, in their own country, and not through pressure from outside.

For these can thrive only where there is plotting with the counter-revolution.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p24\"></a>Then, likewise \u2014 and this is by far the most important point \u2014 you would have educated the workers into independent fighters to a very high degree, as far as it is possible in the present stage.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p25\"></a>If you, Lenin, and you, Zinoviev, Bucharin and Radek, had done this, had chosen these tactics, with your authority and experience, your strength and genius, and if you had helped us to eradicate the faults that cling to us as yet, and to our tactics, then we would have got a Third International that was perfectly firm internally, and unshakable externally, an International which would gradually have gathered the entire proletariat around it, through the force of its example, and which would have erected Communism.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p26\"></a>It is true there are no tactics without defeat.

Again I was delighted with it, as long as I though of the Russian revolution. But over and over again the thought came into my head: the tactics that are brilliant for Russia are bad here. They lead to defeat here.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p1\"></a>You assert here, Comrade (pp. 68\u201474), that in a certain stage of development the masses, must be attracted, millions and millions of them. The propaganda for \u201cpure\u201d Communism, that collected the avant-garde, and educated it suffices no longer in that stage. Now is the time... and next follow once more your opportunist methods that I have already refuted: the profiting of \u201crifts,\u201d of small bourgeois enements, etc.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p2\"></a>Comrade, this chapter also is altogether wrong. You judge as a Russian, not as an international Communist who knows the real West-European capitalism.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p3\"></a>Every word almost of this chapter, wonderful though it may be for the knowledge of your revolution, is wrong for the great industrial capitalism, for the capitalism of the trusts and monopolies.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p4\"></a>I will demonstrate this here: first in small matters.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_38\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p5\"></a>Still need for Propaganda</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p6\"></a>You write about Communism in Western Europe: \u201cThe avant-garde of the West-European proletariat has been won\u201d (p. 70). This is wrong, Comrade. \u201cThe period of propaganda is past\u201d (p. 69). This is not true. \u201cThe proletarian avant-garde has been won ideally.\u201d This is not so, Comrade. This stands on a line (and it proceeds from the same mentality) as what I read from Bucharin, not long ago: \u201cEnglish capitalism is bankrupt.\u201d Also from Radek I read similar phantasies, that were more like astrology than like astronomy. Nothing of all this is true. Except for Germany, there is no avant-garde anywhere yet. Neither in England, nor France, nor Belgium, nor Holland, nor, if I am well informed, in most the Scandinavian countries. There are only a few \u201cEclaireurs,\u201d who, as yet, do not agree about the course that is to be followed. [The English Communists for instance, with regard to the most important matter of affiliation to the Labour Party.] A terrible lie is: \u201cThe period of propaganda is past.\u201d</p>", "<p><a id=\"p7\"></a>No, Comrade, this period is just beginning for Western Europe. There is no firm kernel anywhere as yet.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p8\"></a>What we need here is this very kernel, firm as steel, clear as crystal. And this is where we should begin herewith to build up a big organisation. In this respect we are here to the stage in which you were in 1903, or even before, in the period of the Iskra. Comrade, the conditions, the relations here are far more ripe than we are, but that is no reason why we should let ourselves be carried away, to begin without a kernel!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p9\"></a>For the time being we of Western Europe, the Communist parties in England, France, Belgium, Holland, Scandinavia, Italy, even the K.A.P.D. in Germany, must remain small, not because we like to, but because otherwise we cannot become strong.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p10\"></a>An example: Belgium. Except for Hungary, before the revolution, there is no country where the proletariat is as much corrupted by reformism as Belgium. If at this moment Communism should become a mass-movement there (with parliamentarism, etc.), the vultures, the profiteers, etc., of opportunism would at once swoop down upon it, and drag it into destruction. And it is the same everywhere.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p11\"></a>For that reason, because the Labour movement here is very weak as yet, and almost altogether entrapped in opportunism, because so far Communism is hardly anything yet, we must build up a small kernel, and must fight (in the questions of parliamentarism and the Trades Unions, and in all others), until we attain the utmost lucidity and clearness, until everything has been made as clear as possible theoretically.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p12\"></a>A sect, therefore, says the Executive Committee. Certainly, a sect, if thus you wish to call the kernel of a movement that conquers the world!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p13\"></a>Comrade, there was a time when also your movement of the Bolshevists was small and insignificant. It was because it was small, and voluntarily remained so for a long time, that it kept itself pure. And through this, and this exclusively, it became powerful. We also want to proceeds in this way.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p14\"></a>This is a question of the utmost importance. Not only the West-European, but also the Russian revolution depends upon this. Beware, Comrade! You know that Napoleon, in trying to spread modern capitalism over Europe, was finally wrecked, and had to make way for reaction, when he had arrived there; where there was not only too much of the middle ages, but especially too little capitalism as yet.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p15\"></a>These, your minor assertions, are not true. I will now proceed to the bigger ones, to the most important of all you say: that now the time has come without propaganda to win the millions for \u201cpure\u201d Communism, through the opportunistic policy you describe. Comrade, even if you were right in the small matters, if the Communist Parties here were actually strong enough, this would be utterly wrong from beginning to end. Pure propaganda for the new Communism, as I have often said already, will be necessary here in Western Europe, from the beginning of the revolution to the very end. Because (this point is of such importance that it has to be constantly repeated) it is the workers, the workers alone who must bring Communism. Of other classes they have nothing to expect, in any considerable measure, until the revolution be finished.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p16\"></a>You say (page 72): That period of the revolution has set in in which we have the avant-garde, and in which (1) all class-powers that are against us have become sufficiently disarranged, have fought sufficiently amongst themselves, have been sufficiently weakened by the struggle that surpasses their strength; (2) all wavering, undecided elements, the small bourgeoisie, the small-bourgeois democracy, have been sufficiently unmasked before the people, have exposed themselves sufficiently through their bankruptcy.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p17\"></a>Well, Comrade, this is Russian. In the Russian Government body, which was rotten through and through, these were the conditions for the revolution.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p18\"></a>In the modern, really great-capitalistic States, however, the conditions will be altogether different. The big-bourgeois parties will stand together in opposition to Communism, they will not get disarranged, and the small-bourgeoisie will stand by them. Not in an absolute sense, of course, but to such an extent that it has to determine our tactics.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_39\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p19\"></a>Character of Western Europe Revolution</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p20\"></a>In Western Europe we must expect a revolution that is a tenacious struggle on either side, with a firm organisation on the part of the bourgeoisie and the small-bourgeoisie. The immense organisations of capitalism and of the workers prove this.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p21\"></a>These, therefore, we have to organise likewise with the very best weapons, the best form of organisation, the best and strongest methods of fighting (not with weak ones).</p>", "<p><a id=\"p22\"></a>It is here, and not in Russia, that the real struggle between capital and labour will be fought. Because here is the real capital.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p23\"></a>Comrade, if you think that (from a tendency for theoretic purity), I exaggerate, just look at Germany. There, you have an utterly bankrupt, almost desperate State. But all classes, alike big- and small-bourgeois, as well as the peasant-classes, stand firmly united against Communism. Thus it will be everywhere with us.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p24\"></a>It is true that quite at the close of the development of the revolution, when the most terrible crisis breaks out, when we shall be quite near to the victory, the unity of the bourgeois classes will perhaps disappear, and that some of the small bourgeois and peasants will come to us. But what good is that to us? We must determine our tactics for the beginning and the course of the revolution.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p25\"></a>Because this is so, and has to be so (through the class relations and more even the relations of production), the proletariat stands alone.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p26\"></a>Because it stands alone, it can only triumph, if spiritually it gains immensely in strength.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p27\"></a>And as it can triumph only thus, the propaganda of \u201cpure\u201d Communism is needed here until the very end (quite contrary to Russia).</p>", "<p><a id=\"p28\"></a>Without this propaganda the West-European and consequently also the Russian proletariat, the world-proletariat, is lost.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p29\"></a>And the same holds good for the Executive in Moscow.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p30\"></a>Whilst I wrote these last pages, the news came that the International had adopted your tactics and those of the Executive. The West-European delegates have let themselves be dazzled by the brilliance of the Russian revolution. All right, we will take up the fight in the Third International.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p31\"></a>We, Comrade, your old friends Pannekoek, Roland Holst, Rutgers and myself, truer than which you cannot have them, on hearing of your West-European tactics, have asked ourselves what could be the cause of them. The opinions differed greatly. The one said: the economic condition of Russia is so bad, that, above all, it needs peace. For that reason Comrade Lenin wants to gather around him as much power as possible: the Independents, Labour Party, etc., that they may help him to obtain peace. The other said: he wishes to hasten the universal, European revolution. Therefore millions have to join. That is the reason of his opportunism.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p32\"></a>I myself believe, as I have said before, that you misunderstand the European conditions, the state of things.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p33\"></a>However this may be, Comrade, and from what motives you may act, you will suffer the most terrible defeat, and you will lead tho proletariat into the most terrible defeat, if you go on with these tactics.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p34\"></a>For if you wish to save Russia, the Russian revolution, by means of these tactics, you collect also the non-Communist elements. You join these to us, the real Communists, whilst as yet we do not even have a firm kernel! With this medley of dead Trade Unions, with a mass of half or quarter Communists, in which a good kernel is lacking, you wish to fight against the most highly organised capital of the world, which has all the non-proletarian classes on its side. It goes without saying that in the battle this medley will fall to pieces, and that the great mass will take flight.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_40\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p35\"></a>Why German Workers must not be defeated</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p36\"></a>Comrade, a crushing defeat of the German proletariat for instance, is the signal for a general attack on Russia.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p37\"></a>If you wish to make the revolution here, with this hodge-podge of Labour Party and Independents, French Centre and Italian Party, etc., and with these Trade Unions, the outcome cannot be otherwise.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p38\"></a>The governments will not even fear such an opportunistic lot.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p39\"></a>If, however, you form internally firm, radical groups, firm (though small) parties, then the governments will fear these parties, as only these carry away the masses in great deeds in the revolution \u2014 as the Spartacus League has proved in the beginning \u2014 then the governments will have to release Russia, and finally, when the parties will thus, through these \u201cpure\u201d tactics, have grown powerful, the victory will be ours. These our \u201cLeft\" tactics, therefore, are the best; nay the only ones that bring salvation for us and for Russia alike.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p40\"></a>Your tactics on the other hand are Russian. They were excellent in a country where an army of millions of poor peasants stood ready, and where there was a wavering, desperate middle class. Here they are no good.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p41\"></a>I finally must refute your assertion and that of many of your associates, upon which I have already touched in the third chapter: that the revolution in Western Europe can only begin after the lower, the democratic layers of capitalism have been sufficiently shaken, neutralised or won.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p42\"></a>This assertion also, in one of the most weighty questions of the revolution, proves once more that you consider all things from a purely East-European point of view. And this assertion is wrong.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p43\"></a>For the proletariat in Germany and England is so numerous, so powerful through its organisation, that it can make the revolution, its beginning and development also without, and in opposition to all these classes. And that it even must make the revolution, driven by sufferings in Germany.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p44\"></a>And it can do so, if only it follows the right tactics, if only it founds its organisation on a craft basis, and rejects parliamentarism; if only it strengthens the workers in this way!</p>", "<p><a id=\"p45\"></a>We of the Left Wing, therefore, choose our tactics not only for the reason mentioned above, but especially also because the West-Euroipean proletariat, and in the first place the German and English proletariat, by itself alone, if only it grows conscious and united, is so immensely strong, that it can win in this simple manner. The Russian proletariat had to take roundabout ways, being too weak by itself, and it has done so brilliantly, in a manner far surpassing all that the world-proletariat has ever yet achieved. But the West-European proletariat can triumph by the straight, clear road.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p46\"></a>Thus also this assertion of yours has been refuted.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p47\"></a>There remains one argument as yet to be refuted, one which I have read over and over again with the \u201cRight\u201d Communists, which I heard from the Russian Tratfe Union leader, Losofski, and which is to be found also with you: \u201cThe crisis will drive the masses to Communism, even if we retain the bad Trade Unions and parliamentarism.\u201d This is a very weak argument. For we have no idea how big the crisis is going to be. Will it be as deep in England and France as it is now in Germany? Secondly, this argument (the \u201cmechanical argument of the Third International\u201d), has proved how weak it is during the last six years. In Germany the misery during the last war-years was terrible. The revolution did not break out. It was terrible in 1918 and 1919. The revolution did not triumph. The crisis in Hungary, Austria, the Balkans, and Poland is terrible. The revolution did not come, or did not win, not even when the Russian armies were quite near. But in the third place the argument turns against yourself, for if the crisis should bring about the revolution in any case, the better \u201cLeft\u201d tactics might be just as well adopted.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p48\"></a>The examples of Germany, Hungary, Bavaria, Austria, Poland, and the Balkans, however, all prove that crisis and misery do not suffice. The most terrible economic crisis is there, and yet the revolution does not break out. There must be another cause yet, which brings about the revolution, and which, if it does not work, causes the delay, or the collapse of the revolution. This cause is the spirit of the masses. And it is your tactics, Comrade, which fail sufficiently to awaken the spirit of the masses in Western Europe, which does not sufficiently strengthen it, which leaves it as it was. In the course of this writing I have pointed out that the banking-capital, the trusts, the monopolies, and the West-European and North-American State formed by them, and dependent on them, as they are, unite all bourgeois classes, big as well as small, into one whole against the revolution.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p49\"></a>But this force, uniting society and the State against the revolution, goes further yet. The banking-capital has organised the working class itself in a past period, in the period of evolution, against the revolution: educating, uniting and organising them. And in what way? In the Trade Unions (Syndicalist as well as free), and in the social-democratic parties. By forcing them to fight for reforms only, capital turned these Trade Unions and Labour Parties into counter-revolutionary forces for the maintenance of the State and society. Trade Unions and Labour Parties, through the great-capital, became the support of capital. As, however, these organisations consist of workers, and of almost the majority of workers, and as the revolution cannot be made without the workers, these organisations must be destroyed first, if the revolution is to succeed. And how are they to be destroyed? By changing their spirit. And their spirit can only be changed by rendering the spirit of the members independent in the utmost degree. And this can be done only by replacing the Trade Unions by industrial unions and workers\u2019 unions, and by abolishing parliamentarism in the Labour parties. And this your tactics prevent.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p50\"></a>It is true that the German, French, Italian capitalism are bankrupt. Or rather: these capitallist States arc bankrupt. The capitalists themselves, their economic and political organisations, maintain themselves and their profits, dividends and new capital are even enormous. Only, however, through an extension of the paper-circulation by the State. If the German, French, and Italian States fall, the capitalists go down likewise.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_41\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p51\"></a>Crisis is nearing</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p52\"></a>The crisis approaches with an iron necessity. If the prices rise, the strike-waves rise also; if they fall, the army of the unemployed increases. Misery is spreading all over Europe, and hunger is approaching. Moreover, the world is full of new fuel. The conflict, the new revolution, is drawing near. But how will it end? Capitalism is powerful as yet. Germany, Italy, France, Eastern Europe are not the world yet. And in Western Europe, in North America, in the British Dominions, for some time to come, capitalism will hold together all the classes against the proletariat. The issue therefore to a very great extent depends on our tactics and on our organisations. And your tactics are wrong.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p53\"></a>Here in Western-Europe there are only one kind of tactics: those of the Left Wing, that tell the truth to the proletariat, and do not blind it with illusions. Those that, even though it may take a long time, forge the only strong weapon \u2014 the industrial organisations (uniting these into one whole), and the originally small, but pure and firm kernels, the Communist parties. Those tactics, moreover, that spread these organisations over the entire proletariat.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p54\"></a>This has to be thus, not because we of the Left Wing wish it, but because the relations of production, the class-relations demand it.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p55\"></a>At the conclusion of my expositions, I will draw them up in a concise survey, so that the worker may see everything clearly for himself.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p56\"></a>In the first place, I imagine, there follows from it a clear image of the causes of our tactics (a clear survey of the motives of our tactics), and the tactics themselves: The banking-capital dominates the entire world. Ideologically and materially it retains the gigantic proletariat in the deepest slavery, and unites all bourgeois classes. Consequently the gigantic masses must needs rise and proceed to act for themselves. This is only possible through industrial organisations and abolition of parliamentarism in the revolution.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p57\"></a>Secondly, I will summarise the tactics of the Left Wing, and those of the Third International in a few phrases, so that the difference between your tactics and those of the Third International on the one hand, and those of the Left Wing on the other, become clearly and absolutely evident, and so that the workers, if your tactics, as they probably will, lead to the greatest debacle, may not loose courage, but may see there are other tactics yet.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p58\"></a>The Third International believes that the West-European revolution will proceed together according to the laws and tactics of the Russian revolution.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p59\"></a>The Left Wing believes that the West-European revolution will make and follow its own laws.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p60\"></a>The Third International believes that the West-European revolution will be able to make compromises and leagues with small-bourgeoisie and small-peasant, and even with big-bourgeois parties.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p61\"></a>The Left Wing believes that this is impossible.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p62\"></a>The Third International believes that in Western Europe during the revolution there will be \u201crifts\u201d and scissions between the bourgeois, small-bourgeois and small-peasant parties.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p63\"></a>The Left Wing believes that the bourgeois and small-bourgeois parties will form one united front until the end of the revolution.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p64\"></a>The Third International under-estimates the power of the West-European capital and the North-American capital.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p65\"></a>The Left Wing conforms its tactics to this great power.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p66\"></a>The Third International does not recognise the power of the banking-capital, the great-capital, uniting all bourgeois classes.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p67\"></a>The Left Wing on the contrary builds its tactics on the uniting power.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p68\"></a>As the Third International does not believe in the fact that in Western Europe the proletariat will stand alone, it neglects the mental development of this proletariat; which in every respect, is deeply entangled in the bourgeois ideology as yet; and chooses tactics which leave the slavery and subjection to bourgeois ideas unmolested, intact.</p>", "<h5 id=\"sigil_toc_id_42\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a id=\"p69\"></a>Left-Winger to free Workers\u2019 Minds</h5>", "<p><a id=\"p70\"></a>The Left Wing chooses its tactics in such a way that in the first place the mind of the workers is made free.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p71\"></a>As the Third International does not found its tactics on the freeing of the mind, nor on the unity of all bourgeois and small-bourgeois parties, but on compromises and \u201crifts\u201d; it leaves the old Trade Unions intact, trying to join them to the Third International.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p72\"></a>As the Left Wing strives above all for the freeing of the mind, and believes in the unity of the bourgeois parties, it realises that the Trade Unions must be destroyed, and that the proletariat needs better weapons.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p73\"></a>The same motives induce the Third International to maintain parliamentarism.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p74\"></a>The same motives also induce the Left Wing to abolish parlamentarism.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p75\"></a>The Third International leaves the condition of slavery such as it was in the Second.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p76\"></a>The Left Wing wishes to change it from below upward; it seizes the evil at the root.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p77\"></a>As the Third International does not believe that in the first place the freeing of the minds is needed in Western Europe, nor that all bourgeois parties will be one in the revolution, it collects masses around it, without inquiring whether they are really Communist, without determining its tactics, on the supposition that they are such \u2014 as long as they have the masses.</p>", "<p><a id=\"p78\"></a>The Left Wing wishes in all countries to form parties, consisting exclusively of Communists, and determines its tactics accordingly.

I will gather my statements in a few theses, so that, the workers who must work for themselves, to gain a clear insight into those tactics, may have them before their eyes in a concise, surveyable form.
